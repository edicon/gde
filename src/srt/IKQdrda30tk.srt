dear friends and followers and the short

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:03,510
screencast I'm going to show you a new

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,580
feature in chrome dev tools that will

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,140
help you analyze the amount of

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,090
JavaScript and CSS that you're shipping

6
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,099
and especially on mobile where

7
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,660
everything in performance especially

8
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,509
critical so let's get started I'm going

9
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,480
to go to chrome dev tools and then I can

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,060
hit command shift P and then click on

11
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,189
coverage so this is the new coverage

12
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,500
feature in chrome dev tools then I can

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,470
start instrument coverage and then I can

14
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:36,059
go for example to Google flights you

15
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,309
will see in real time the JavaScript

16
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,890
resources and CSS resources that are

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,800
being requested and at the same time you

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,629
can see how much of this javascript is

19
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,210
being used in green and how much of it

20
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,289
is not being used in bread so 1.7

21
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,829
kilobyte of JavaScript 41% of it is not

22
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,739
being used that's approximately I think

23
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,329
it's okay for this kind of website but

24
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,520
this is still running in real time and

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,260
you have to use the websites more

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,600
because the more you use it the more of

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,490
your javascript is being used and that

28
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,619
makes a lot of sense so after you use

29
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,560
this website maybe you use most of the

30
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,240
functionalities you can then click on

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,119
the JavaScript and if I make this

32
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,439
smaller you can see the lines here green

33
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,299
show these are the lines that are being

34
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,090
used whereas those that are red are not

35
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,549
being used and I think in the case of

36
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,229
Google Sites it's very well optimized

37
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,659
for mobile but if I go to assert it to a

38
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,909
different website so if I stop and clear

39
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,450
go to Trello calm which is probably not

40
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,820
very well optimized for mobile when I

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,509
start recording you can see the entire

42
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,600
jQuery library is being loaded but we're

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,060
barely using about 35% of it so 65% of

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,490
it is not being used so you see we're

45
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,560
wasting a lot of resources to load

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,469
JavaScript and CSS that we will not use

47
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:06,320
so if I double click on it here and

48
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,990
let's go again scroll down

49
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,350
and you will see big chunks of unused

50
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,940
jQuery code or unused JavaScript codes

51
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,040
so make sure to use this tool whenever

52
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,690
your shipping fast experiences

53
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,060
especially on mobile as it'll help as it

54
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,130
will help you rule out all the

55
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,720
JavaScript and CSS that you will not

56
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,480
need I hope you enjoyed this tip and see

57
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,350
you soon
