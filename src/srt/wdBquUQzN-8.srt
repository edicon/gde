here's a quick tip whenever you're

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:03,959
working with grid or flexbox

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,670
and you're not entirely sure why

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,890
something looks the way it does use

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,320
Firefox dev tools which has some amazing

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,570
layout dev tools let's take a look so

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,190
I'm here running Firefox developer

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,260
edition because I need to be on Firefox

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,420
65 if you're watching this video in the

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,340
future you will have access to these dev

11
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,529
tools as long as you're on Firefox 65

12
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,990
and above I'm over here on this website

13
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,750
grid by example and if you take a look

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,429
at this website you can see it the nav

15
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,880
bar over here is using a display flex in

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,610
fact you can see that from the dev tools

17
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,410
over here from the inspector panel

18
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,020
because we have this flex icon and now

19
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,870
as a Firefox 65 we can click on this or

20
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,870
you can simply go to the right and you

21
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,489
see this is a Flex container and then

22
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,829
you can toggle this or enable it and

23
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,680
this will show you an overview of this

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,410
Flex element alongside its Flex items

25
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,329
that's really useful if you're still

26
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,280
getting started with flex or if you're

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,989
not sure why something is behaving the

28
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,789
way it does and you can see here this is

29
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,949
a Flex container and these are the Flex

30
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,380
items over here not only that you can

31
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,780
also see from these boxes over here that

32
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,030
we are using justify content space

33
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,130
between so if you experiment with this

34
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,860
and use space around you will exactly

35
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,570
see where the space is being distributed

36
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,200
same thing if you do Center or flex and

37
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,770
or flexor and we've got the same helpers

38
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,840
for grid so if you scroll down a little

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,970
bit and if we take a look at the wrapper

40
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,860
over here we can see that it's using a

41
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,290
grid I can click on the grid and now I

42
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,049
can see the layout of the grid here on

43
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:39,390
the right and you can also see that on

44
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,680
the screen itself

45
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,689
this is the grid gap and these are the

46
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,299
grid cells you can also put the mouse on

47
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,070
top of them and you will see which grid

48
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,490
cell this is and if you're working with

49
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,500
multiple grids or maybe even massive

50
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,329
grids you can change the colors of this

51
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,189
indicator and that will make it clearer

52
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:58,439
for you to understand which one of these

53
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,840
grids this one is that's a nice tool

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,850
that I really like in Firefox give it a

55
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,200
try and let me know what you think and
