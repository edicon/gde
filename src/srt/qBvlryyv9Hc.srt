and there and there

6
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:54,780
good thank you hi good afternoon so i will talk about

7
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:02,220
english feed yourself and iv my name is keila menezes fernandes this i work

8
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,900
as a software consultant at totvs worx plus google develop expert

9
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,990
in web technology and now also only volunteer at campinas front-end someone

10
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,860
here it was at the front campinas this past year

11
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:24,300
and then it sells a lot of masses, be sure to go next year.

12
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,880
generation with the intention of inserting people in technology is also

13
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,740
writing an introductory book to engler and I am also part of the team

14
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,490
corsas team which is a blog writes these things about web

15
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:49,090
it's good to seek instant age is very important for how we user is going

16
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:56,780
successfully interact with applications o and this whole ecosystem of frameworks

17
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:03,650
has helped us to create applications that are more interactive helped our

18
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,040
productivity with developer people creating kind of

19
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,640
application but at the same time has brought a lot to see network in the sense that the

20
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,430
applications have to load many things and can be slow so question

21
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:24,800
would we go back to vanilla ds at the same time we want to use all separate

22
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:32,110
sign up or provide and also follow the evolution of the web because

23
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,350
to keep your application more and more updated, but how will you do it?

24
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:44,330
this without throwing away everything we did six months ago and that implies us

25
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:50,230
maybe change our perspective a little bit if you ask you that that

26
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,370
they image represents

27
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,250
hi can come then

28
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:07,010
and the other person who has it exactly because we already have our

29
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,390
exposure company to think they are square because it's usually

30
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:17,359
representation of what we see, but it could be easy for a cube coming

31
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:24,870
seen from another perspective hi and then what would that be

32
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,000
is an image of a cube and two dimensions

33
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:40,960
hello good could also be the face of a quick logical test that we don't

34
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,610
would have stuck in three dimensions and we would get summer tesseract

35
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:51,759
well then the idea of ​​reuse it is not new in the 60s douglas

36
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,900
michael spoke about the idea of ​​creating components based on architecture

37
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,500
in components 50 years later brad for his ideas atomic design

38
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:08,520
hi and the idea is that we can create several different component elements

39
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,010
in different ways attendance of the framework keys for this but I don't

40
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:19,220
I see no problem we create I think this diversity is important but

41
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:25,030
consume in a single way hi and the one that sold the web component

42
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:32,440
that you can create reusable elements encapsulated in any

43
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:39,370
that is application and if you've stopped to analyze a

44
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,830
element that a priori in that standard perspective that we think the

45
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:52,630
input in the browser enabling us to gift in chrome you will see that in

46
00:05:52,630 --> 00:06:00,560
true the input in capsule a div hi and there but ok for what we

47
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,330
will use the frameworks so right the documentation site hurts there

48
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:12,889
he thinks content is just a static part and he doesn't use igor he is all

49
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:18,199
static but for some parts that need more of these images to be

50
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,380
more dynamic has more interactivity they go contronics webb

51
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:29,830
hi what's up she sold her me what is she me the library from the angle you

52
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:36,940
manages to encapsulate component elements to wrap in web components with the idea of

53
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,800
you are able to use these components in whatever the

54
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,930
agnostic application the framework and for this presentation I will create a

55
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,180
a component that represents the comment that you can like it is

56
00:06:53,180 --> 00:07:00,319
very simple has a text has an author of the amount likes and the heart icon

57
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,740
that you can click to like that comment you came from there

58
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:11,430
just comment it works that way okay

59
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,810
hi and then i have no challenge on twitter yesterday i don't know if you guys have seen it but it was

60
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,430
participate I still think that until her but two three o'clock in the afternoon I don't think

61
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:26,490
four more hours in the afternoon which is a challenge for what size you

62
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:35,970
imagine that this would be the component there using aave aave compressed and then I

63
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:42,240
I’m going to draw two people to retweet this one you’re in my

64
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:50,310
my twitch and you will compete for this complete course of the ultimate corsa tô de

65
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,689
bike that has these four young creed modes

66
00:07:54,689 --> 00:08:00,509
the good is how it would be so i create a component i will want a component

67
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:05,369
igor basics so i will define a template will define the styles but

68
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:13,019
for me to create this component using the library it comes from i will define the

69
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:17,849
encapsulation of it will be tea dome type so I will have my simple that

70
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:26,189
represents the text the author the amount of e-liquid likes i have an event that

71
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:32,819
will change the value of my liquid so that component is the temple

72
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:38,129
it will display the text I will have the footer part that will have quantity

73
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:44,310
lakes my heart icon i can i'm going to set an event that is going to call the

74
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:49,950
hi toboggan and how this application swallows

75
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:55,770
it is not a common application so i will define this component in my

76
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,960
between the component so that it does not boot and as a normal component

77
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,860
which is commonly done, right and not a builder, I'm going to use this create

78
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,890
custom it lies that it is a function of the library and then I will define the editor

79
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,820
so that I have distances independent of this component and shoot

80
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,970
zana and joke cost it is i will use define which will be the selector o the tag

81
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,390
html that i'm going to use to use the components and other applications and i

82
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:33,870
need to create this put this ng-bootstrap method so that this application does not

83
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,810
to be initialized with common application is good to build i will bring a

84
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:46,439
I liked it there and obviously only that in the command of engebuild - prod I will add

85
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:54,120
this parameter out put hard noni for here do not put the régis in the games

86
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,620
chilled hi and then I'll get all those

87
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:05,010
chilled young people and I will pack them using nude so I will simply

88
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,550
generate in my folder is elements it ended with me dejas un

89
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:16,510
hi and to facilitate isolation of this component of fever she is mind me

90
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:23,230
set on my jason feet a teske right to make the bild is elements that then I

91
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:29,440
use these two these engebuild commands counted those parameters and the

92
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,680
that goes to tell all this in the only javscript already has to I can do that already

93
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,269
have to attack for that have to still x bill after that facilitates all this

94
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:43,839
work but I'm doing it manually that later I want to play with these

95
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,740
files that I'm going to package hi and to use it's like using

96
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:58,430
any common element, right, that uses html so set the properties

97
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:03,700
just demonstrate here how it would be

98
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:12,399
oh ok i have ok to see well no

99
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:19,150
well then i'm going to have to go html here

100
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:27,669
good so i'm importing that javascript is that i want two

101
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:36,170
I’m going to comment and we’ll see here so I have my

102
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,570
component to interact with it only what time the

103
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,850
size 177 baskets

104
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,880
and I didn't like it very much so I said like this let's think about other

105
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,920
options is because it happens because it

106
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,130
need to bring all the dependencies of the going there also has a sound file

107
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,750
s that is to make change detection hurt there so all of this is going

108
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:10,750
in my band or generated right, we are the minimum number of young people

109
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:18,460
cript only that doesn’t have the basics to load this component so this is the

110
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:24,400
The idea of ​​having only what is necessary to determine the parts of the application is not

111
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:30,070
something new, like going there he has the issue of modules that uses strategy

112
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:35,170
on-demand loading which are the lazy-load modules then for the pef to

113
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:40,750
a route I define that certain module that has all the components

114
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,890
all the elements that I need to load that route will only be

115
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:53,129
loaded start that ipef hi or else the change itself that had

116
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:57,509
in relation to the service and version of the classes we use so that we don’t have

117
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,579
logic directly related to visualization how to do here are http

118
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:07,080
so in this service, the service had to be defined in the modules

119
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,240
it's just that there has to be a change part of the same as you use that decorate

120
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,790
a class with a good injector at sign and you allow you to do three sheik at the level of

121
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,420
good provaider so these are several strategies to

122
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:26,430
we will even have a presentation here in the js building that will be a rescue that

123
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,330
are all thinking about treaties that we can do to carry only

124
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:35,260
with the necessary to determine the application parts right

125
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:41,740
hi and then live appears in this context a new rendering engine error

126
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:47,950
generalization moto windows is a software that will do all the drawing part

127
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,940
texts and images in the case of the web application we will usually have to have

128
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:57,670
my l with the css styles and then you say wow but again it will change because

129
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:03,730
i know people have a lot of trauma that came from ingrid s that changed and

130
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,830
I will have to present all applications I will have to throw everything away

131
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:16,960
google itself uses in 600 applications the latest version of the master that

132
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,160
it was hurting my jaw there so once we are going to enable hiv to be the default

133
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,880
how the application rendering engine is the same for all applications

134
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,170
have to change, have to pass all the tests so he has a concern

135
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:38,540
great with compatibility and hiv but mostly what the

136
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,460
today we will have a lecture of the heroes he will talk about hiv but

137
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:49,610
in detail I wanted to have today this is it here you can enable hiv is a

138
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:55,490
person opt in only i'm going to do something different so this here with a

139
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:01,220
experiment that I did for two weeks that the contribution of her mind

140
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,960
for the new live design

141
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:14,020
hi and how would it be if we had already integrated i've with her mind that in

142
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:19,690
truth are actually are you have igor components and encapsulated by web

143
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:27,400
component would be you could have a wii ng-component that you are would put your

144
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:33,040
component would define that I showed how it is today in the element only that it still doesn't

145
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:40,150
there is this was a suggestion that the hurting team brought her in india to check this

146
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:47,050
year because it swallows you a lot so the hurting team is to share with

147
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,130
community the ideas they are having so that we can achieve

148
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:57,370
contribute the feedback on it so I started from the following observation

149
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:03,430
today I raised some hypotheses I did my experiments and I'm going to share

150
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:08,760
analysis of this experiments with you throughout the entire code that I will show

151
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,050
here is in the middle ruby ​​kit is exactly the same my name is with two elles one

152
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,850
project in ai heaven on

153
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:24,720
hi and this is an implementation but I don't want you to get attached to

154
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:34,350
solution but to the problem how to create how to create web applications that are more

155
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,980
instant

156
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:41,399
is because it doesn’t matter we just understand why we’re doing it but why

157
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,920
we are doing this is a disruptive approach and we are at a conference

158
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,980
of technology this is technology this is to be supplementary

159
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,730
good so to start that that i'm going to do i'm going to do everything manually

160
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:02,279
because i don't have that ng-component iv yet so i'm going to create

161
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:06,240
a class that extended html it lies with all that textual properties

162
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,939
tolix liquid there i need to define the two methods observe is tribute i

163
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:18,620
callback tax for each of these attributes of mine and then I'm going to use

164
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:24,949
still to stick and deprived of the live even has a ceiling there in the methods

165
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:30,480
so I'm going to import the two methods the income ceiling is component if the part of

166
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,799
version eight ok i'm using one there and the ones to call it component income

167
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:43,799
only and for the ceiling of tec teens these tektites and then to render this

168
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,320
component and I just go to the constructor

169
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,550
of that because this class it two-component that will cover my

170
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,540
language component only for child component I will not create the way with

171
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:02,360
the pattern I will import I have dynamic import so I have there awaiting

172
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:08,690
import the file path and then the component network and return an instance of

173
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,190
my component i define the face and says why it will be stuck on that side

174
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:17,780
component and then I define all the properties and manually call the

175
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:25,240
detectchanges in my hi component and then in that one in my file that

176
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:31,120
I'm packing, it's generating bild, I'm not going to put the priest wires because

177
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,680
I don't want it I prefer it in this case it has the importing sony part I don't

178
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,570
I need this more with live because the change detection has totally changed the

179
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,610
how it will be done hi and then when it opened I will see that

180
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:51,730
in addition to all those already clips that generate in the application will have a separate one that I

181
00:18:51,730 --> 00:19:00,160
read here comment component cause it's taking s5 s6 the javascript and here we go

182
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,000
see what happens here

183
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:11,800
well then there for this one I called there I saw lazy lazy eye I saw that I have and if

184
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,170
import dynamic I'm just going to define a button here on this button I'm

185
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,290
calling this function is from there i'm going to comedy that i put in this file

186
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,320
javascript to do what you want to trigger will hit some

187
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,070
properties and will give a service on my body

188
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:33,320
and I only have a button I don't have the distance here in this component's html

189
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:41,610
and then all right here he loaded my pack loaded that javascript just has

190
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:47,040
the function that makes you learn and there’s nothing else but when I click here

191
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:53,060
it will create a web component that capsules the component me there I saw

192
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:59,000
centralized with vivi and only then did he load javascript

193
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,530
o and attached the component cannot dynamically right

194
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:12,309
and there it is and how can he work

195
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:18,370
so I saw why it has the concept of locality today when a compilation

196
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:23,500
is done in the language he has to analyze all the dependencies he needs to have a

197
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:29,919
global knowledge of the application as a bird concept and this is going to change and this

198
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,850
implies what I'm going to be able to accomplish the fragile component talking about

199
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:39,470
much easier than what is done without live and the modules in English they

200
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:45,680
historically strip was the role and very important in the context of compiling

201
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:51,020
all the elements that we use parent directives for the components of a

202
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,730
and then for me written a lot of things if you start using swallow for the first

203
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:01,880
time is one of the most difficult concepts and is essential because an application is equal to

204
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,340
characterized by being modular but with this concept of live this form of

205
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:13,010
compilation you will not need to declare I had no module that does not

206
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:17,000
I liked it, there was no mode in that application, no mode.

207
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,640
my component no way the molds already so until they become obsolete

208
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:29,720
hi and then how do we do that he creates aesthetic definitions each with

209
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:36,260
each component each directive each country the injected ones will all have a file

210
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:42,520
typescript with definitions with pure rendering-related functions

211
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:51,010
creating all of these elements good so it creates a syntax tree

212
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:58,180
abstract that represents that static definition updating the tone today as it is

213
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:04,420
made without live we have the html template from the html temperature that is

214
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:09,160
depending on the color heitor creates all the metadata that represents that

215
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:16,180
component and there is an atomic unit that I roll interpreter that it will

216
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:21,929
be responsible for distancing my component for updating my component

217
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:30,179
and to add it in the gift and this is the code that has in the functions that everyone

218
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:34,830
English elements pass through the rendering process that mars out

219
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:41,610
I don't see this giant suite code so all the elements down by the same

220
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:48,929
execution path depending on 15 component case directive but for example

221
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:53,249
for this application I'm only using the component, but for the one from her

222
00:22:53,249 --> 00:22:56,440
had to import all this all this code

223
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,150
and today how is it with hiv how would be the definition of that which component this

224
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,550
class it has the component type the selectors that represents that

225
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:12,160
component the milk time that a function and a factor that will be will be mine

226
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:17,800
entire component statically defined in that class definition is descriptive

227
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:24,520
and then I can update the gift incrementally is an html template

228
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,630
to present my component but I don't have the metadata anymore I don't need

229
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:33,430
plus that regular interpreting I only have the instructions these situations

230
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:37,470
static and the situation part updates the gift

231
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:41,960
hi and then we can do it I left it here in a much more efficient way

232
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,760
that I let us as we already know we don’t put in our

233
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,200
our band functions that are not used for example but with this

234
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,490
concept of the ipad location we will be able to make a concept at the

235
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:01,380
dependency i will show example have for example i have here mess with the

236
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,340
traditional I have this class that imports two functions just told me that

237
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,780
you said you had in my method i invoke samsung together i'm calling the

238
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:15,450
another one will not be in my pack now imagine that I have this more grandson who

239
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:20,730
is receive as a parameter exam candle that is a boolean and then I invoke you told me

240
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:25,170
that had more I'm just going to call a chance suffocation this future value

241
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:30,570
it's like saying that our question in my application I always focus on one

242
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:35,790
meter of passing false only that this sad analysis which is static it will

243
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:39,570
add all two functions from my pack one

244
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:43,590
good so for example here let's see how the function definition would be

245
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:48,360
template for this component the simple component that has an input name

246
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,950
that receives a good variable so this definition of that

247
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,659
component would have the template function of the code blocks one to create and

248
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:01,980
treatment then it uses this function of the start mind and another one to update

249
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,720
because the name can be variable, I also need to run the detection of

250
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,350
changes and you will be able to make you put a break point and you are

251
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:17,639
actually debugging how component change detection is done

252
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:25,639
used with live only let's say i invoke this component with the name

253
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:29,639
which is a value a fixed value the sherlock cases

254
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:35,669
and how would the template function of the definition of that component only have the

255
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:39,470
block to create and the sad thing here is done at the level of

256
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,550
dependency it will not add the block that updates because you said no

257
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:49,480
never changes an elementary

258
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:56,530
well then we know that the band is smaller and very efficient and all that

259
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:01,600
is being possible because of these static definitions that are created

260
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,420
to represent these elements good and is that I love you within that

261
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:12,330
monolith interpreter we saw that side function wanted to see you for

262
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,260
individual instructions

263
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:23,030
it is only here that first because I showed you that I generated

264
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:30,980
javscript of that mind of 177 cabaites the second gave 125k bytes and in

265
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:38,150
truth has a reduction of thirty percent that was I thought with import

266
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:44,570
dynamic was going to be less than with tactical import was the second hypothesis I made

267
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:49,690
the more I showed you here now good and if you compare the tchan that

268
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:56,500
that separate file he tried a job but compared to 125 below until

269
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,470
negligible value of it so if i think you will have to carry

270
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:06,970
regardless of whether you use the new component this 125 channels it happens

271
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:13,260
because why the trench that what happens to your foot that makes the normal sheik

272
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,850
with dynamic import it's not as efficient

273
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:22,340
hi and then i put a static matter so i'm importing my

274
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:30,010
fan i will eat or commit component hi and then i will not use the import

275
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,840
dynamic I will simply call the render

276
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:40,280
and then we'll see and how it would be here so I will have here the

277
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,480
even though it gives html only I will not be creating fly line I will

278
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,679
add it right here

279
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:56,770
and here I have these two components and the size of it gives 39 heads and

280
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:04,390
this is a seventy percent reduction compared to using the

281
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:08,029
dynamic sport to render the angry component

282
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:13,099
and we will compare then how it would be from the first is a strategy to the

283
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:21,499
second and the last first thing is mind 187 end up compressing 55 the bike with the

284
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:28,639
dynamic sport option 125 cabs compressed 43 below and have a sport

285
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:34,389
dynamic 39 and compressed

286
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:46,040
15 fights 15k bytes in 15 15 couples

287
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:53,330
yes it is and here I had all that manual work to create another

288
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:59,470
component in hand call the hiv to rendered have that are of changes

289
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:05,030
obviously the hurting team already has this vision that you will be able to create

290
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:08,000
of components using it but we don't have it ready

291
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,920
implementation was just for us to have an idea of ​​what will be possible to be done

292
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:18,740
that would be a suggestion and it was also from india confiding that it would be having a

293
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:25,160
new of the color heitor ng she is mind and this one of the color heitor set selector

294
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,850
plate the probable the dependents at the level of dependence because sometimes

295
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:33,470
you use an and if and you have a door in all your at sign swallows that

296
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:38,270
all the definitions you will define the dependencies right in your component

297
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:45,670
but this is still something that is being studied if it is going to be that way

298
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:53,250
is so wanted to bring this new person you have is how to carry

299
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:59,090
applications to take more instant be more efficient

300
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:08,750
and that's it you know we have created a lot for technology science has

301
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:15,560
evolved already form sensational and so it is a step but there is no right step

302
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:21,050
don't do it wrong because all the steps will take us are part of our

303
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:24,860
journey and I will take us to what we want to build knowledge

304
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,570
science if you notice everything we can connect a person today

305
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:33,680
from one point in the world to another point in the world we have an image of a

306
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,340
black hole o and all these are just tools

307
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:44,289
we should never put the tools above our principles

308
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:50,169
above what we really want to obtain and as technologies we are these

309
00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:55,360
path recorders i really like when they say i'm an engineer who

310
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,049
we are engineers because we build things not physically

311
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:05,519
bridges the building used but we build this journey for knowledge

312
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:15,260
thank you [Applause]
