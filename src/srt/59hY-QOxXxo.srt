1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440

hey hey hey everyone who EDA sorry for

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,480
my heart gee I live in a small town in

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,200
the North called Amsterdam you know and

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,889
today I want to talk to you about

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,359
progress pop-ups are we all developers

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,760
20% 30 40 yeah I think we're all

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,960
developers I'm gonna tell you a secret

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,359
and a little bit of a bad news when

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,980
we're building progressive web apps we

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,830
always forget about the users and for

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,760
some reason when you're building

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,140
progressive web apps it's always about

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,690
the technology but when we start talking

14
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,360
to users when you start showing them

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,809
native apps and progressive web apps

16
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:40,620
sometimes they can't tell the difference

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,870
if this is a native app or progressive

18
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,270
about but it's not because it's built in

19
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,050
react or view it's not because of web

20
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,820
components it's just because of the user

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,829
experience and the user interface and

22
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,129
also the real the reliability so today I

23
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:57,510
want to talk to you about progressive

24
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,190
web app from the user experience part

25
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,859
from the user interface part but I don't

26
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,180
want to talk about it I actually wanna

27
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,490
live code so let me put my screen and

28
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,930
you know the thing about live codes they

29
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,479
are quite dangerous especially with

30
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,250
pwace thank you we might need a new

31
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:25,050
domain

32
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,219
so because life codes are dangerous I

33
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:29,899
thought how can we make them even more

34
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:33,219
dangerous and I found an idea which is I

35
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:35,569
did not prepare for it I'm actually

36
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:37,789
gonna ask you for we're gonna do some

37
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:40,069
improv did anyone see the improv shows

38
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:44,090
sometime so an improv you basically ask

39
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,829
the audience for suggestions and you do

40
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:51,109
based on their suggestions so anyone

41
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:54,500
building a PWA yes what is that about if

42
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:07,589
you don't mind saying okay boring next

43
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,549
that's too matter if you do p.w about

44
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:15,000
pwace but I'll keep it in mind

45
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,500
other suggestions so technically an

46
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,760
improv you're supposed to take whatever

47
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,780
the audience says I'm violating it man

48
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:31,849
super exciting yeah okay anything else

49
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:35,090
no no I the thing is I want to combine

50
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,319
ideas that's it's not a no conference up

51
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:44,510
and digital dictionary all right how can

52
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,250
you combine all of these together any

53
00:02:49,250 --> 00:03:00,730
more ideas so I like the unicycle one

54
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,959
okay we'll do something about unicycles

55
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,880
so based on my introduction I want to

56
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,590
tell you that a successful progressive

57
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,389
web app is not just about having scripts

58
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,980
like service worker and the web app

59
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,930
manifest but it's about when you meet

60
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,239
user expectations so I want to show you

61
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,069
this and I will actually take questions

62
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,109
while I do the live code so if you have

63
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:23,450
questions please go to slide odo just

64
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,569
another in the URL slash hashtag

65
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:28,760
questions and I'll have some of the

66
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,350
questions on my phone here if I forget

67
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,690
to take questions you can remind me

68
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,000
so we're gonna do something about

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,240
unicycle first these are the questions

70
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,580
so what we will have here is the setup

71
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,580
that I had I think you can't see

72
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:03,810
anything yet all right can you see my

73
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,750
screen yeah so we just have an

74
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,090
index.html SRC index of GS they're all

75
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,670
empty and we have a whopper

76
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,560
configuration it's pretty much very

77
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,209
basic and I'm gonna start with the index

78
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:22,380
and we need to just run webpack dev

79
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,510
server so we're on what pack dev server

80
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,090
and now we're up and running on

81
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,640
localhost 8080 and we're gonna start

82
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,570
building our app which is a do we do

83
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,310
people who unicycle have a different

84
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:41,300
weather no so we take the unicycle with

85
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,650
over other ideas someone said something

86
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:50,730
about tasks list yeah what was it okay

87
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,890
so we're fixing unicycle something so in

88
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,580
cycle return all right

89
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,740
I'm gonna start building this up and we

90
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,630
may use web components if we have time

91
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,070
later on but I'm gonna start with a

92
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,990
concept that you see a lot in native

93
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,610
apps and that's called the app shell

94
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,030
does anyone know what an app shell is so

95
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,970
10% the app shell is if you open any

96
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,010
native app like the Twitter app just

97
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,560
half a millisecond one millisecond

98
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,450
before you get the content you're gonna

99
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,220
have the app shell which is the

100
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,590
structure of the app without any content

101
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,080
without any data and this is something

102
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,390
users are used to a lot in native apps

103
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,970
because every single app has it on

104
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,790
Android and on iOS so even the camera

105
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,430
app if you open the camera up just the

106
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,990
split of a second before the camera

107
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,050
loads you're gonna have the app shop and

108
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,230
then the camera is just a blank black

109
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,640
three so let me show you what I mean by

110
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,350
that and let's start building our up

111
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,010
shell and I'm kind of doing server-side

112
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,170
rendering but just directly by inlining

113
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,940
the app shell because the absol is the

114
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,560
first thing you want to render on the

115
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,880
screen so I'm just gonna write the HTML

116
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,270
inside of here which may seem weird but

117
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,740
you're not writing everything just the

118
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,260
app shell so let's start with the header

119
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,950
Oh

120
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,700
first we'll need to add a script so we

121
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:16,290
can have a live reload this is gonna be

122
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,230
mind oh yes yeah now I have live reload

123
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,270
working let's start with the header and

124
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,370
then we will call it unicycle repair

125
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:33,470
then put that in each one and then we

126
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,760
basically have something that looks from

127
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,230
the 90s so let's go ahead and add some

128
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,600
inline stars I'm also in lining the

129
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,850
stars because you're giving full

130
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,640
priority to these HTML and CSS and

131
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,070
potentially JavaScript later on you want

132
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,840
the browser to render this first thing

133
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,530
so then we give this 90 just trying to

134
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,310
separate semantics from CSS and then we

135
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,280
say the header will have a certain

136
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,130
background color let's use a blue for

137
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,160
example and of course in my spare time I

138
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:11,270
memorize color numbers

139
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,760
and then we give it a color white oh but

140
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,500
I like to use CSS properties so let's

141
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,290
say this is gonna be the primary and

142
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,150
then we put it on the root the root is

143
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,120
basically the root of the document

144
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,169
most parent element I think and then we

145
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:29,960
need to remove the margin on the body

146
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,880
and then the h1 has a margin we can also

147
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,940
margin zero for fonts when building

148
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,440
progressive web apps you can if you

149
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,910
really care about performance and you

150
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,200
want to have something that looks like

151
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,800
native apps a lot of native apps use the

152
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,290
system font which is San Francisco on

153
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,610
iOS Roboto on Android etc you can now do

154
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,470
it as easy as system - UI a browser

155
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,440
support isn't great you can fall back to

156
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,630
all of this it's a lot yeah but it

157
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,700
basically tries every single font on

158
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,620
every on every operating system but

159
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,810
again you can replace all of this with

160
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,180
just system UI and I think browser

161
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,270
support for it is a 70% but if you wanna

162
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,010
have the best support keep it and then

163
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,010
start with system UI and now if I reload

164
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,800
the page and you inspect and go to the

165
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,159
rendered font it's an SF and s this is

166
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,349
San Francisco because I'm on a Mac if

167
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,330
you open the same website on an Android

168
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,280
it's gonna be Roboto and the nice thing

169
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,990
about it is you're not wasting resources

170
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,670
you're not getting anything from the

171
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,920
internet you could still use web fonts

172
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,690
this would only be for the app shell for

173
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,460
the system for everything that has to do

174
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,530
with the with your app but not the

175
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:01,170
content so I know it looks horrible but

176
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,620
give me some time we can also say that

177
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,020
the navbar will have a height of 60

178
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,420
pixels and then you can give that as a

179
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,990
height here and then we need to Center

180
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,440
things so display flex or grid there's

181
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,020
no I think place items Center but you

182
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,630
can do a line item center justify

183
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,909

184
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:27,199
when it's all centered cool and now

185
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,849
technically this is an app shell maybe

186
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:36,299
we can also give a slight grave for for

187
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:38,279
the body but I want to take it a step

188
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,609
further and this step further is I like

189
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:43,289
to call it advanced app shell and this

190
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:44,969
is also something you see in native apps

191
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:48,299
which is a lot of the apps have a

192
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:50,639
navigation at the bottom it tabs

193
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,249
navigation does anyone know why it's at

194
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:57,569
the bottom yes I see a lot of this it's

195
00:09:57,569 --> 00:09:59,999
because the thumb most people use the

196
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,069
app with their thumb so it's

197
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,329
conveniently positioned at the bottom

198
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:05,009
because you can easily navigate between

199
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:06,869
them so I want to do this

200
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:09,779
this tabs over here and I want to show

201
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,939
you hopefully you will learn a couple of

202
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:14,309
things from it because I think nowadays

203
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,049
is quite easy to make these tabs

204
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,899
if you focus a lot on the UX as well so

205
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:22,049
we can make it tabs and then those will

206
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:25,769
be links with a class top and inside of

207
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:30,029
it we will have a SVG icon so let's go

208
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,899
and find some icons from materials do

209
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:42,070
they have a unicycle like yeah

210
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,900
well yeah I don't think they have it's

211
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:52,339
like okay technically we're supposed to

212
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:54,320
get four different icons but I'm just

213
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,170
gonna use the same one to save up time

214
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,640
because we will have four pages at the

215
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,570
bottom so I'm gonna place this over here

216
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:07,160
I'm also in lining the SVG just for save

217
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,589
some time the P here and that's gonna be

218
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:14,960
tasks if we said we are repairing some

219
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,480
of the things and then I'm gonna

220
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,210
duplicate this a few more times because

221
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:25,570
we're gonna have several tabs okay and

222
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,940
this will be let's say help this will be

223
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:35,390
profiled and then stock we have the tabs

224
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,529
I know they look horrible we want to

225
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:41,270
position them at the bottom in a way

226
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,310
that they look like tops so let's go

227
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,490
ahead and make the tops give it a

228
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,560
display grid and then grid template

229
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,020
columns you can do one of our four times

230
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:57,110
or repeat for one of our and now let's

231
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,140
give it a background color of white oh

232
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:06,310
and position it at the bottom so fixed

233
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,470
bottom zero and now we need to give it a

234
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:16,100
left:0 right:0 it's getting there need

235
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,959
to remove the text decoration on the

236
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:23,540
link and basically place everything in

237
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,910
the center right and we still need ages

238
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,650
a long item center we have any questions

239
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,040
let's see what is it like to be a

240
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,970
Microsoft MVP let's talk after

241
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,350
oh I can tell you we get a free Visual

242
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:58,550
Studio code sorry I'll slide at those

243
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:05,150
slash hash tag questions so slide it

244
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,030
yeah it doesn't show here oh there are a

245
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,230
lot more questions I didn't see that

246
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,270
do we need web pack for this yes I am

247
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,370
using webpack it has a really small

248
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,530
configuration I wanted to do it with

249
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,390
parcel but I also want to use script

250
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,850
Idol and they don't support that yet

251
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,900
it's just a entry output but please

252
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,300
don't use this for production it's this

253
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,810
is horrible for production

254
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,870
what about user experience when it comes

255
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,040
to installing the app any

256
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,360
recommendations thank you we will

257
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,220
actually talk about this in a minute so

258
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,230
let me just figure out why this is not

259
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,770
working

260
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:48,200
let's give it also a height ABB's height

261
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:55,910
70 pixels so you might be wondering why

262
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,400
am i giving the height as a CSS

263
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,690
variables I want to show you that in a

264
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:04,710
minute

265
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:14,880
okay this P has a lot of margins

266
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,310
ooh I did forget something which is the

267
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,080
box-sizing border box that's one of the

268
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,890
annoying things when you start

269
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:27,490
completely from scratch so yeah no

270
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:31,070
difference but that's fine

271
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,580
it's planned okay this is our app so far

272
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,860
and then let's revert to color initial

273
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,700
and then one more thing on the on these

274
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,710
is by default we're going to give it an

275
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,650
opacity of 0.6 and only when the tab is

276
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,740
active then we give it an opacity of 1

277
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:57,820
and we can also transition this and now

278
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,190
we go down and only the first stop will

279
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,690
be active and now what we need to do

280
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,750
next is the screens so what will go

281
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,610
inside of it so let's go ahead and

282
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,560
create the main section which will have

283
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,100
the screens and then we will have a

284
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:20,890
screen x for let's say a B C D these are

285
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,240
the four screens that we're gonna have

286
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,510
and are you laughing at my code then

287
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,540
we're gonna put these screens next to

288
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,510
each other but every screen should be

289
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,190
full screen more or less so let's do

290
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,090
that with a screens

291
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,790
let's give it a height tough so what

292
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,620
would the height be here not a hundred

293
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,960
percent not a hundred VH so we will use

294
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:55,030
car with 100 V H minus the CSS variables

295
00:15:55,030 --> 00:16:00,250
so the navbar height minus D bar tops

296
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,980
height and just so you see you may need

297
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,230
to close your eyes

298
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,080
yeah that's working you can only tell if

299
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,690
you do this like screw it up and then

300
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:16,510
yeah that's working now every screen has

301
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,430
to be full screen and inside of it so

302
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,690
this is where you can also do a display

303
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,330
grid and then grid template Collins

304
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,270
repeat for it's not gonna be one of our

305
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,909
but just show you what would it be

306
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:33,539
100 feet W and that's that's also

307
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:38,189
planned it's because you want to add the

308
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:43,589
overflow X scroll hopefully no it's

309
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:47,219
because the screen sorry

310
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:51,589
oh oh thank you

311
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:54,149
and now look look at it look how

312
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:56,369
beautiful it is you scroll you get to

313
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:58,559
the second page I know what you're

314
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,609
wondering what if you release mid yeah

315
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:06,899
it's it sucks how did I not think about

316
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:15,059
this how can we fix that so I was just

317
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:16,500
saying if somebody knows about this new

318
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,429
Web API and CSS property it's the over

319
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:24,269
it's the scrolls nav API so scrolls snap

320
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:27,629
type you're saying on the x-axis I want

321
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,879
to have scroll snapping which means if

322
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:32,129
you scroll and release it's gonna snap

323
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:34,799
to one of the pages so scroll snap type

324
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,769
on which acts and which axis X and it's

325
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:41,129
mandatory and then you have to say on

326
00:17:41,129 --> 00:17:44,190
the children this no cause snap a line

327
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,769
will be start or Center there would be

328
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:48,149
no difference here because it's full

329
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:50,490
page and look at this let's enable

330
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:54,929
disable scroll release it's gonna snap

331
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:58,950
back to a scroll release it's gonna snap

332
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,810
back to

333
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:06,619
[Applause]

334
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:16,850
so

335
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,179
Wow very political question try to get

336
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:26,610
that at the end for these ones I would

337
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,490
recommend image to the ants like Claudia

338
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,909
nary so any suggestions for good tooling

339
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:35,190
to create for years all start up screen

340
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,789
images yeah I found it tool once for iOS

341
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:40,679
but I don't remember what it is sorry

342
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,929
but we can research it together if you

343
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:50,130
ask me later on all right

344
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:55,590
next what should we do next ok

345
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,059
so eventually this will be web

346
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:58,830
components hopefully we have time so

347
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,830
that's gonna be up tasks and then this

348
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,340
is gonna be up stock and then yeah same

349
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,289
for the rest and the next thing I want

350
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:09,299
to do is I want to tell the user hey

351
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,159
this is an app that you might need why

352
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:12,659
don't you add it to the home screen

353
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:14,730
but in a way that is not very annoying

354
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,380
we're not gonna have a pop-up nor a

355
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,620
toast it's gonna be quite smooth by

356
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,350
showing this I can over here so let's

357
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,970
copy it and then let's place it over

358
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,600
here give this an ID so Add to Home

359
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:37,490
screen a to HS and now it looks great

360
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:42,510
white and then position it on the right

361
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:48,419
so position:absolute right yeah it's

362
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,539
gonna be here but by default is gonna be

363
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:52,950
hidden so it's gonna be displaying on

364
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,149
only when we give it a class show then

365
00:19:56,149 --> 00:20:01,289
we will show it to display block but

366
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:03,240
before we get to that you cannot ask the

367
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,980
user to install the app if you don't

368
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,840
have a service worker so we're gonna go

369
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,730
ahead and generate the service worker

370
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,870
and you need to install I am using word

371
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,720
workbook sorry web pack here so you need

372
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,519
to install the word box what pack

373
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,100
plug-in which I already installed to

374
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,529
avoid awkward internet issues so we just

375
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:26,400
require web pack work box

376
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,559
what PAC plugin yeah it exists and word

377
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,620
box is a library that helps you generate

378
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,390
serviceworker code so you can integrate

379
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,040
it with what park it becomes so much

380
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,630
easier and so we can read the plug-in

381
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,860
here which is work box plugin and we add

382
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:53,430
a new okay and under this object there's

383
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,100
the inject manifest plugin and it just

384
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,220
takes two options the source of the

385
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,080
service worker so you're gonna provide

386
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,850
it with a partial piece of service

387
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,620
worker it's gonna take it and it's gonna

388
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,990
generate a new one so that will be as

389
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,230
RCS wogs which we need to create and the

390
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:16,410
one it generates is swgs so we need to

391
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:21,600
create our SRC SW and we also need to

392
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:29,010
restart webpack okay and now we have to

393
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:36,660
import I was hoping you wouldn't notice

394
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,760
this we have to import the library from

395
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,260
city and this is changing in the next

396
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,350
version it it will be bundled in your

397
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,610
own repository but for now you have to

398
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,710
import it from CDN and what's annoying

399
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,330
is that you have to always manage the

400
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,090
versioning here and what you tell what

401
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,120
word box is simply you use the

402
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,190
pre-caching module and then you ask it

403
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:04,230
to free cash and route a certain

404
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,520
variable that will be dynamically

405
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,390
injected which is called Prakash

406
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,280
manifest so this variable will be

407
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,690
injected I will show you in a minute

408
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,840
this will be the list of the assets that

409
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,730
you have and this will instruct

410
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:21,990
workbooks to precache them when the

411
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,640
service worker gets installed so that if

412
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,590
we go offline the user can still get

413
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:29,940
access to the option so this is good for

414
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,820
now we need to register the service

415
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:38,250
worker so we can do that in index so if

416
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,570
exist a navigator just to make sure it

417
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,740
doesn't break on all older browsers and

418
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,389
then we give it the path of the Service

419
00:22:46,389 --> 00:22:48,639
Worker this returns a promise so you can

420
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:50,799
dot then but I'm gonna assume that my

421
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,330
code is perfect and we don't need that

422
00:22:52,330 --> 00:23:01,809
and now we have to go fullscreen let's

423
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:05,639
see yeah you start seeing these these

424
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:07,929
logs from work box they only run on

425
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,419
localhost and they tell you what's going

426
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:17,019
on you can also go to application you

427
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:18,850
will see a service worker is now

428
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:23,559
installed this one here as wjs this

429
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:28,120
shouldn't have been clicked and if you

430
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,029
go to the car storage we have the web

431
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:33,700
box work box Prakash there is Prakash in

432
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,000
this file now there's a bit of magic

433
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,419
let's go back and cancel and run NPM MPX

434
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,690
web pack and if you look at the distal

435
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:48,250
der we have this swgs let's take a look

436
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:56,830
at it colleges this yep and it's

437
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,799
basically the same as our code oh we

438
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:02,289
don't really need to import it it's

439
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:07,389
imported here so let's go back always

440
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:09,039
nice to figure this out during the live

441
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:16,330
code so let's run it again and in the

442
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,580
serviceworker code they import the

443
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,289
library for us and they import this file

444
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:21,669
which we'll take a look at in a minute

445
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:24,039
and this is the code we wrote and pay

446
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,629
attention to this self underscore

447
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:27,429
Prakash manifest because this is coming

448
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:28,620
from

449
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,250
Prakash manifest the father was

450
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,080
automatically generated by word box and

451
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,690
this basically contains your assets but

452
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,759
it also has a plus with it which is the

453
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:41,830
revision and this allows word perks to

454
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,019
be way more efficient than us writing

455
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:45,879
the code manually because it only

456
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:48,140
updates the assets that have changed and

457
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,910
can know if it changed based on the

458
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,280
revision so this is why a lot of people

459
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,350
recommend using a tool not writing

460
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,270
service circle yourself because it's

461
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,970
just very efficient to the cache if you

462
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,370
were to write it yourself you will have

463
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,500
to clear the cache add a new one every

464
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,080
time and it's gonna be slow from a

465
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,810
natural perspective also consume a lot

466
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:13,550
of data so let's go back to our backup

467
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:21,320
server and I also want to mention

468
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,050
something that in this life code we are

469
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,120
not going to handle the update of the

470
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,790
app so just like if you're on the store

471
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,140
you need to tell the user there's a new

472
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,600
version allow them to update so I have

473
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,220
to do it from dev tools this is of

474
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,280
course not for production and update

475
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,720
takes around 20 minutes so I cannot

476
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,670
cover it in the store but every time I

477
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,710
make a change to the server server it

478
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,900
will only update to the new one when you

479
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,120
click skip waiting of course for dev

480
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,220
tools you can click update on reload and

481
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,720
it's always showing in the fresher one

482
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,610
but this is only for development this is

483
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,880
not how we do it for end-users so now

484
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,880
let's get this checked and let's go to

485
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,040
the cache we have all of these files

486
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:06,340
cached which means now if we go offline

487
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,710
so go offline will it work

488
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:14,520
I hope so

489
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:18,890
it works so this is our app shell and it

490
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,290
still works offline why because even

491
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,120
though the network request fails it's

492
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,800
actually getting them from the cache and

493
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,860
this couch is APR this couch is actually

494
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,170
something you can access from the

495
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:34,160
windows hope you have this caches API so

496
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,230
if you know the name of the cache which

497
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:44,640
is work okay it's a lot can we copy it

498
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:52,940
works we can go to the console and then

499
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,850
cache is not open but this is going to

500
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,540
return a promise so you can wait and

501
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:05,420
then cash and then you can cache that

502
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:16,860
get if you get the index.html

503
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,510
at the match if is we're looking for all

504
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,400
oh yeah good point

505
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,250
it's the match sorry so gosh that much

506
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,740
and then index.html and it's going to

507
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,460
return a promise so wait it answers

508
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:39,890
response with the typo and you will get

509
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,300
a response the reason why I didn't get a

510
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,650
response is because I have to type all

511
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,780
of this but I'm gonna avoid it what I

512
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,550
was just showing you is that these

513
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,110
caches you can access them from the

514
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:52,040
window scope if necessary now let's go

515
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,780
to the next step and what we're gonna do

516
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,750
now is add the manifest if you want to

517
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,640
allow users to add your app to the home

518
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,770
screen you have to have an app manifest

519
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:07,790
and I already generated one before the

520
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,960
talk because I'm not gonna waste your

521
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,410
time writing all of this so what did we

522
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:15,980
call it in cycle repair and then you

523
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,420
have to give it the theme color the

524
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,030
icons I'm just using one of the icons

525
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,650
for my project so please don't use them

526
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,830
in your code

527
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,720
the background-color stand alone will

528
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,790
hide the browser UI and what is the

529
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,250
start here now you just need to link

530
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:38,340
this in the index as a rel manifest and

531
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,940
then manifest at JSON and you can test

532
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,070
that in dev tools which is very

533
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,990
convenient just go to the application

534
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:57,440
tab but we need to go online again

535
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,570
alright and you can see all of this here

536
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,930
these icons are just random icons and

537
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:07,660
now we're ready to ask the user to add

538
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,670
the app to the home screen so the way

539
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:12,790
you do that is by listening to an event

540
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:18,700
called yes someone who sing it if it was

541
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,430
correct before install prompt and this

542
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,910
gives you an event object do recommend

543
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,890
to prevent default on it because older

544
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,690
versions of Chrome were showing the mini

545
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,130
bar at the bottom which is annoying

546
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,900
especially if you have a top bar and

547
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,360
this doesn't show it but now this event

548
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,280
object you can call prompt on it

549
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,830
whenever you're ready so first what

550
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,420
we're gonna do is we're gonna say the

551
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,380
add to homescreen

552
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:47,140
element let's show it so we give it a

553
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:51,070
class show and then this add to

554
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,430
homescreen when the user clicks on it

555
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:57,370
what will we do we will call event dot

556
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:04,720
prompt and then this this is blocking

557
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,210
until the user says ok or cancel and

558
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,770
then you will have the user choice

559
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,560
promise which gives you the result and

560
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,440
this will be either dismissed or

561
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,930
accepted under result that outcome so we

562
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:25,270
can cancel out resulted outcome and what

563
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,160
I recommend for you is to always send

564
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,410
this to analytics because you want to

565
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,390
understand what kind of users what kind

566
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,010
of devices are accepting or rejecting

567
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,750
the prompt

568
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:41,190
will it work yeah so first this is only

569
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,170
showing up on browsers that support it

570
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:46,429
which is now I think Chrome edge and

571
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:49,080
Firefox but not sure which one is a dis

572
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,179
table or not this table but it only

573
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:53,730
shows up when the event fires and the

574
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,260
event will not fire if the user already

575
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,540
added the app to the home screen or if

576
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,429
it's the first second that the users on

577
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:01,440
your domain because it doesn't make

578
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,200
sense to add a website you just saw the

579
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,700
browser will wait a few seconds and

580
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,610
probably adjust your interaction so now

581
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,840
what you can do is you can click on it

582
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,290
and this is supposedly for mobile but it

583
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,030
also works on desktop if you look over

584
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,360
there

585
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:23,640
I'm gonna cancel it do it again okay

586
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,380
click it click on it and then you get

587
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:33,610
unicycle repeat repeat

588
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,740
yeah that was an accident as well you

589
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,020
install it and now you have an app

590
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,970
without dev tools of course and you have

591
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,340
it as an app over here and this theme

592
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,740
color is not because I have dark themes

593
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,090
because I specified it as 2 to 2 again

594
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,770
this is supposed to be for mobile I will

595
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,600
actually deploy this right now so you

596
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,450
can try it there'll be quite interesting

597
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,270
let's go back let's build for production

598
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:09,360
so MPX for park - P and deploy the dist

599
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:24,540
folder nice a worse domain name ever but

600
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:31,620
it's HTTP superficial flock if you want

601
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:36,870
to try this on your phone yeah it's this

602
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,060
domain make sure to have HTTPS a few

603
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,770
minutes HTTP this domain doesn't

604
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,270
redirect and you cannot get the

605
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,610
serviceworker to work so then you cannot

606
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,160
get the out to homescreen to work okay

607
00:32:47,160 --> 00:33:00,330
let's get some questions

608
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,899
how much money can you ask for this app

609
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:10,100
you think how do you implement native

610
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,289
components such as sliders or motion

611
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:15,769
gestures such as a shake I think you

612
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:17,809
will need JavaScript for the shake I

613
00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:19,600
don't know if we have access to the

614
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,899
accelerometer for it yeah that's a great

615
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:25,730
website where you can see also browser

616
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:29,570
support for it native components sliders

617
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,190
I think there is a slider component

618
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:48,180
input type range let's see

619
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:53,200
yeah you can use this one and it works

620
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,100
someone asked about Visual Studio

621
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,020
extensions they're not a lot it's just

622
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,770
prettier and peacock and lit and these

623
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,140
ones someone else a important question

624
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,030
which is how do you deal with is

625
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,419
dropping upstate when switching apps is

626
00:34:08,419 --> 00:34:11,450
this still happening I think it was

627
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,960
fixed in the last iOS version the main

628
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,760
problem with the IRS now is that if you

629
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,580
have authentication and the user adds

630
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,560
the app to the home screen this app on

631
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,639
the home screen has a completely

632
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,590
different state than Safari so you're

633
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,970
not logged into Facebook you're not

634
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,889
logged into github in that case I

635
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:30,080
generally just don't recommend pushing

636
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,870
out to home screen for iOS users just

637
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,940
keep them in the browser and it works

638
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,879
fine and for Android you can do it and

639
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:39,470
that's what I'm personally using and it

640
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:48,590
works fine yes now we have more time to

641
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:51,530
do little element things so the reason

642
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,570
why I like to use little iment is just

643
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:59,900
because it's very very tiny ish so we're

644
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,520
gonna create a new files only 6

645
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,630
kilobytes gzipped so we'll create the

646
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:12,220
was the first page called app tasks and

647
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,800
then we will create this app tasks page

648
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,070
which extends from the lead element and

649
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,170
then you have a render function and then

650
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:28,280
we just say it works even though it

651
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,610
won't and then you need to register it

652
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,710
so custom elements that define and then

653
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,930
that's gonna be after tasks with the

654
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,450
definitional class of tasks and you need

655
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:46,010
to import this part so we import it here

656
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,590
and there is something I'd like to do in

657
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,750
most of my apps the modern ones this

658
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,640
script tag here which is at the bottom I

659
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,710
like to move it in the head which is

660
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,910
super scary because if you just make it

661
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:02,280
type equals module or if you make it a

662
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,590
Singh then it also acts like a preload

663
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,600
header at the same time you're telling

664
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,430
the browser about it but it also doesn't

665
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,840
block rendering so the browser can

666
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,420
continue with the HTML so it's just like

667
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,890
doing a script at the bottom and having

668
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,660
a preload at the top I know this is a

669
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,250
hundred percent correct for type equals

670
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,560
module I just cannot remember for async

671
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:31,150
can anyone confirm it is most likely yes

672
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,510
yeah in that case we'd have to use defer

673
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:36,870
to guarantee the order all right now

674
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:48,580
let's go back here and we need to serve

675
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:54,020
and it does not work Oh

676
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,280
because we are running on the older

677
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,080
version of the service worker so I

678
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,340
technically have to go here and then we

679
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,050
have out it ok so the reason why I

680
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,430
didn't work the first time is because I

681
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,930
was seeing the older version of the app

682
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,910
and I had to reload to see the new one

683
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,560
but this is the same thing with native

684
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,060
apps when you open a native app on your

685
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,910
phone it could be not the latest one you

686
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,410
would have to go to the store check if

687
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,930
there's a new one and update you can

688
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:21,240
kind of do the same with progressive web

689
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,910
apps but yeah unfortunately it's a

690
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,230
little bit outside of the scope for now

691
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:29,580
but what we want to do here is oh yeah I

692
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,290
still need to fix this because if you

693
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,820
click on the stalk it just reloads the

694
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,600
page so this is also part of the app

695
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,250
shop so then it has to go in the

696
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,310
index.html as inline JavaScript and that

697
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:44,070
may also sound look weird but you're

698
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,200
basically giving full priority to the

699
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,660
script and it's gonna be very minimal so

700
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,080
you say I'm gonna find all of the tabs

701
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,470
and then for every tab

702
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,640
is anyone using addeventlistener

703
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,770
nowadays

704
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,560
yes I keep hearing about react should

705
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,060
try it one day and then when you click

706
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:17,030
on the tab you will we will try to find

707
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,660
the previous tab that was active and

708
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,900
then we removed the active from it and

709
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,430
then we find the one that was clicked

710
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:28,900
and then we give it a last list of

711
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,030
active and finally even prevent default

712
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:37,200
now reload let's see if it works

713
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,920
click yeah this one is active and it's

714
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,050
not changing pages but there is

715
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,790
something really important when I talk

716
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,390
to you about this is not ok when we talk

717
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,310
about user experience see this empty gap

718
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,710
here this is super frustrating for users

719
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,110
so when building native like progressive

720
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,760
web apps you want to really focus on

721
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,310
these small details and then this should

722
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,900
be hundred percent there should be no

723
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,770
empty spots at the top or at the bottom

724
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:12,640
so I had a margin in there I think yeah

725
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,370
a padding through with a padding top we

726
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:18,940
can put it on the a element and it's a

727
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,860
really simple fix if it works but yeah

728
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,840
that's really important here and you

729
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,370
also want to give feedback that has been

730
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,250
clicked potentially a ripple effect but

731
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,290
I only have six more minutes so I don't

732
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:33,250
think we're gonna make it you can also

733
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,020
make it such that when you click on one

734
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,660
of these pages it Scrolls to the second

735
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,420
page of course but I'm gonna skip that

736
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,500
because you know how it works

737
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:47,260
and next I'm gonna create the second

738
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,560
element which is what was the second

739
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,700
element called app stock so we duplicate

740
00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:01,480
this call it app stock

741
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:09,330
and this is gonna be I'm gonna assume

742
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:13,130
there's a method here that says like

743
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:16,740
activate or so something a custom method

744
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,900
that you want to call when this page has

745
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,760
rendered you can do it with first up

746
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,560
updated but I just want to show you

747
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,150
something that has to do with

748
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,640
performance and web components so I'm

749
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,020
just gonna say console the debug

750
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:33,930
activate was hold and go back to the

751
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:41,940
index import this to app stock reload

752
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,580
the page we're gonna have up stock it

753
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,610
works and the nice thing about our

754
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:49,470
components is that they are just HTML

755
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,350
elements with their own properties and

756
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,660
methods so if you find the app stock you

757
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,730
can call activate on it which is my own

758
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:00,350
custom method and that works great

759
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:04,080
activate was called until you decide you

760
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,910
start having a lot of components and you

761
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:08,460
want to lazy load them but thankfully

762
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,340
it's very easy you just import as a

763
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,790
function this is a browser feature you

764
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,560
can use it in all browsers but if you

765
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,210
have what park or parcel it takes care

766
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,700
of Polly filling it there may be one

767
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,680
browser missing it I'm missing from it

768
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,190
yet you just import it and then you can

769
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,980
have a promise when it actually loads

770
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:33,030
and it works but this is gonna break now

771
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,280
because at the moment this is running

772
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,570
app stock doesn't exist so you can do it

773
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,640
in multiple ways you can you can do it

774
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,680
with the dog down here I just want to

775
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,360
show you another method with custom

776
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,210
elements because other code grows

777
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,830
sometimes you don't have access to this

778
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:52,020
import and the right file what you can

779
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,490
do is you can use this window that

780
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:58,890
custom elements dot anyone guess it yes

781
00:41:58,890 --> 00:41:59,710
yes

782
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:02,560
one defined and you give it the name of

783
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,270
the app stock and this is basically

784
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,250
returning a promise that will only

785
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,080
resolve when the browser has the

786
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,440
definition for app stock and then yeah

787
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,790
one defined then it's kind of safe to

788
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,140
call it I say it's kind of safe because

789
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,840
it may still not be in the Dom but here

790
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,280
I know that it's always gonna be in the

791
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,730
DOM and then reload and then activate

792
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:27,490
was called and I think what I did here

793
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:30,490
is the main page is the one the user is

794
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:32,680
gonna see immediately so I loaded this

795
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,530
as a normal import but this one it's a

796
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,900
secondary pager so then I lazy loaded it

797
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,940
because you want to give you want to

798
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,100
make this load as far this as fast as

799
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,590
possible and then lazy load all the

800
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:50,260
other pages oh that was technically oh

801
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:55,510
I'm gonna build and take some more

802
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:58,430
questions

803
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,180
I'm gonna build to a new domain just

804
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:05,620
easier for me flash it squirrel don't

805
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:11,690
forget the HTTP if you wanna try this

806
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:20,590
and

807
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,400
you please check in the project to

808
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,430
public repository yes I will do that and

809
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:29,210
I will tweet it afterwards so put it on

810
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:33,110
github then tweet it do you know why

811
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:38,030
people say and then I'll tweet it they

812
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,860
just want more followers I don't know

813
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:51,500
why they do that how to handle up

814
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,210
updates from the serviceworker cache is

815
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,610
everything I wish I can answer that in

816
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:57,530
one minute but it's really a bit more

817
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:01,510
complicated but what I did here is I

818
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:05,060
gave a full talk of about this topic not

819
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,010
as a life coach just a full talk so I do

820
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,630
recommend that you watch it if you're

821
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,460
interested in this and I also mention

822
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,010
the update quickly you can check out my

823
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:17,840
website and my Twitter what else

824
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:23,520
what about ie is that a serious question

825
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,300
well not serious because you can you can

826
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,250
still support ie with the script type

827
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:33,120
module let's let me show you quickly I

828
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:35,150
know it's not a serious question but

829
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,180
it's good to bring it up when you have a

830
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:43,490
script script async

831
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:46,550
sorry script type module this will only

832
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,260
run on modern browsers it will be

833
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,740
ignored by Internet Explorer so you can

834
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,630
ship modern JavaScript here and then for

835
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,720
all browsers you can have a script that

836
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,330
has a no module attribute which is on

837
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,820
purpose ignored by modern browsers and

838
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,650
then what you can do here you can do

839
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,710
main - legacy is and for this uShip

840
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:10,550
polyphase you you bubble or babel it and

841
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:13,520
then this works for JavaScript for CSS I

842
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,110
have no idea how you can make this play

843
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:19,580
grid work on ie and for the final

844
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:23,720
questions how does it compare to

845
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,570
automatic splash screens Android house

846
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,070
the question implies that they get

847
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,840
generated automatically by Android to be

848
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:45,740
honest I'm not aware of that are they

849
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,550
okay because if you try this up you will

850
00:45:48,550 --> 00:46:07,749
have a splash screen as well

851
00:46:07,759 --> 00:46:10,009
so let me see if I open like the Twitter

852
00:46:10,009 --> 00:46:12,859
app so you have the splash screen and

853
00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:14,150
then you have the app shell even on

854
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:15,890
native apps so it's basically doing the

855
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:18,859
same thing I think also for iOS but I'm

856
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:23,089
not a hundred percent sure oh yeah money

857
00:46:23,089 --> 00:46:29,089
yeah okay and scroll stop support this

858
00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:31,219
from IE 10 not bad yes but it has a

859
00:46:31,219 --> 00:46:33,229
different syntax it's using an older

860
00:46:33,229 --> 00:46:37,609
version that you can also use how

861
00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:39,829
maintainable is PWA like this can use

862
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:42,859
dependency bots not sure what the

863
00:46:42,859 --> 00:46:44,209
question is about but I guess I'll just

864
00:46:44,209 --> 00:46:46,009
take the other questions afterwards

865
00:46:46,009 --> 00:46:48,460
thank you very much for having me and
