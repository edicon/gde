hey everyone in this video I'm gonna

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,870
talk to you about dynamic imports I'm

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,089
gonna show you a specific use case where

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,010
I've used dynamic imports on learn

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,440
JavaScript online on all lessons I want

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,110
to display a thumbs-up and thumbs-down

7
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,519
preview over here and then when you

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,230
click on it it opens an optional

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,240
feedback where you can send it so this

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,039
is both for negative reviews and also

11
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,109
positive reviews this is some

12
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,580
functionality that I'm not going to use

13
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,560
on every single page because if I go

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,109
back I will have the editor and I'll

15
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,849
have the challenge page and in a

16
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,560
challenge page I have the editor and

17
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,540
completely different functionality so

18
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,800
that's why it doesn't make sense to

19
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,200
always include this JavaScript section

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,850
that is responsible for the feedbacks

21
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,520
because then as I add more features to

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,649
this website the mores can become slower

23
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,420
and I definitely don't want it to become

24
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,309
slow so let's take a look at the code

25
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,020
here this is the code for the lesson

26
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,270
review it's not very fancy and it could

27
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,489
be much much better I'm not using any

28
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,260
framework over here so I just have a

29
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,629
string of the element that I'm

30
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,969
displaying and I've got a bunch of code

31
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,180
that actually makes it work and what I

32
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,150
do is that in the lesson so whenever I

33
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,310
know that this is a lesson I want to

34
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,590
dynamically import it so I want to only

35
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,229
import it when I know I will definitely

36
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:19,020
need it and rather than doing it as an

37
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,210
import at the top like this where you do

38
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,939
an import and then I don't have anything

39
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,799
exported from this module so I just

40
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,040
import the lesson reviewed ojs rather

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,170
than doing that and including the script

42
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,950
as a burden for every single page on my

43
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,290
website I will instead dynamically

44
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,390
import it and here's the syntax for it

45
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,540
it's simply an import using the

46
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,880
parentheses and this makes it a dynamic

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,890
import which you can call from anywhere

48
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,320
inside your code so you can even call it

49
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,930
inside an event listener or a fetch

50
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,840
callback and then you get the path to it

51
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,189
that's gonna be lesson review Dulce s

52
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,560
and this returns a promise so you can

53
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,930
resolve it and do something when it's

54
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,909
fulfilled and if you're exporting stuff

55
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,619
you can also access it under the module

56
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,700
if it was a default function then you

57
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,379
call it with module the default if it

58
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:13,750
was

59
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,510
action or if it was something else like

60
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,850
other method you can call it like this

61
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,010
but I'm not exporting anything so optic

62
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,610
I'll get rid of all of this and let's

63
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,560
take a look at browser support so

64
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,180
dynamic imports work on the following

65
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,760
browsers Firefox has it behind the flag

66
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,700
in the developer edition but you can

67
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,320
already use it because when you're using

68
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,990
webpack webpack makes sure that the

69
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,310
dynamic imports will work in all

70
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,610
browsers so that's pretty much it but if

71
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,200
you keep it as is once you build your

72
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,840
project you're going to get a zero ojs

73
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,850
or one dodgy s you will get the bundle

74
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,010
ID so instead you have to tell what Park

75
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,620
what's the name of this chunk you do

76
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,180
that with the web pack chunk named

77
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,190
comment so this is a special comment

78
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,350
that's read by a buck and then I'm gonna

79
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,110
say this is gonna be lesson review now

80
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,640
let's take a look at this if I go in the

81
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,830
browser this is the web version because

82
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,510
this is what I already did and I reload

83
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,020
the page and because we are on the

84
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,260
lesson page you will see over here that

85
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,250
I have the lesson review being loaded so

86
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,080
this is the dynamic import being loaded

87
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,540
so it only renders on pages where it's

88
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,320
needed which means if I go back I will

89
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,430
not find this lesson review anywhere in

90
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,350
this page just like any other

91
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,150
performance tip it doesn't mean all of

92
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,769
your inputs should be dynamic inputs

93
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:37,780
because that might slow things down you

94
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,420
have to measure and see if it has any

95
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,790
impact another thing you can do which

96
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,650
I've also been doing in this website in

97
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,140
some places but it requires a polyfill

98
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,000
to work on all browsers is to use the

99
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,590
request idle callback and then if you've

100
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,230
got a lot of work that you need to do

101
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,840
you can just delay this until the

102
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,209
browser has some idle time but don't

103
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,310
forget that you need a polyfill for that

104
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,400
at the time of recording so when used

105
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,320
properly dynamic imports can help you

106
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,480
ship and experience as fast as possible

107
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,570
and then dynamically import or lazy load

108
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,160
other functionality that you may not

109
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,680
need immediately and this also helps you

110
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,560
add more and more features without

111
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,720
really slowing down your web application

112
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
if you only import the ones that you

113
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,710
need I hope you enjoyed this quick tip

114
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,240
and I'll see
