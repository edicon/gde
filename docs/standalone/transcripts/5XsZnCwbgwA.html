data-end="338.88">writing modes so let's have a look at</span> <span data-start="338.88" data-end="341.52">writing modes because it shouldn't</span> <span data-start="341.52" data-end="344.909">matter

vertical writing</span> <span data-start="348.659" data-end="350.25">mode there's no reason why that grid</span> <span data-start="350.25" data-end="351.87">shouldn't behave in exactly the same way</span> <span data-start="351.87" data-end="354.27">you know tipped over on its side so</span> <span data-start="354.27" data-end="356.34">writing mode is actually a really good</span> <span data-start="356.34" data-end="358.319">place to begin an exploration of new</span> <span data-start="358.319" data-end="360.629">layout because even if you actually</span> <span data-start="360.629" data-end="362.819">never use a writing mode other than the</span> <span data-start="362.819" data-end="365.639">default understanding writing mode tells</span> <span data-start="365.639" data-end="367.83">you a lot about how grid and flexbox</span> <span data-start="367.83" data-end="370.59">actually work because these layout</span> <span data-start="370.59" data-end="372.36">methods have got writing mode support</span> <span data-start="372.36" data-end="374.52">bakes in because they've been developed</span> <span data-start="374.52" data-end="376.229">sort of since the point at which we</span> <span data-start="376.229" data-end="377.94">thought we'll hang on people actually</span> <span data-start="377.94" data-end="380.19">use vertical writing modes perhaps we</span> <span data-start="380.19" data-end="381.539">should have layout methods that cope</span> <span data-start="381.539" data-end="386.219">with that so a horizontal top to bottom</span> <span data-start="386.219" data-end="388.919">writing mode like English or Arabic you</span> <span data-start="388.919" data-end="389.909">know a left-to-right or right-to-left</span> <span data-start="389.909" data-end="392.43">language it doesn't matter which way the</span> <span data-start="392.43" data-end="394.949">text runs if it's horizontal then we</span> <span data-start="394.949" data-end="396.81">have an inline dimension which runs</span> <span data-start="396.81" data-end="400.08">horizontally the inline dimension that's</span> <span data-start="400.08" data-end="401.129">the way that your text</span> <span data-start="401.129" data-end="402.959">runs in the writing mode that you happen</span> <span data-start="402.959" data-end="404.759">to be using so if that's the in line</span> <span data-start="404.759" data-end="407.55">dimension then the block dimension is</span> <span data-start="407.55" data-end="409.889">the direction in which blocks layout</span> <span data-start="409.889" data-end="414.209">down the page in that writing mode so if</span> <span data-start="414.209" data-end="416.55">we take a vertical writing mode then the</span>

data-start="455.209" data-end="458.189">the fact that web design is essentially</span> <span data-start="458.189" data-end="460.229">tides the physical dimensions of our</span> <span

data-end="469.259">layout now if I was to turn that into a</span> <span data-start="469.259" data-end="472.05">vertical writing mode what's going to</span> <span data-start="472.05" data-end="474.149">happen then is that the grid is kind of</span> <span data-start="474.149" data-end="476.939">gonna flip but the width that's applied</span> <span data-start="476.939"

data-start="2341.299" data-end="2343.609">implementations we've got this very</span> <span data-start="2343.609" data-end="2345.97">interesting thing called display</span> <span data-start="2345.97" data-end="2348.559">contents interesting feature because it</span> <span data-start="2348.559" data-end="2352.19">lets us remove a box and visually from</span> <span data-start="2352.19" data-end="2354.71">the display so if for instance you've</span> <span data-start="2354.71" data-end="2356.39">got a bunch of list items they need to</span> <span data-start="2356.39" data-end="2357.859">have a ul and then you've got your</span> <span data-start="2357.859" data-end="2360.98">allies if you had a pair and sort of</span> <span data-start="2360.98" data-end="2362.749">grid structure going on you just wanted</span> <span data-start="2362.749" data-end="2365.359">those list items to sit on the grid you</span> <span data-start="2365.359"

data-end="2377.299">know using a screen reader should know</span> <span data-start="2377.299" data-end="2380.359">that that's a list so this is really</span> <span data-start="2380.359" data-end="2382.7">kind of how this works I've got a grid</span> <span data-start="2382.7" data-end="2384.98">here as we know direct children</span> <span data-start="2384.98" data-end="2387.23">participate in grid layout the children</span> <span data-start="2387.23" data-end="2389.569">of those items do not adding display</span> <span data-start="2389.569"
