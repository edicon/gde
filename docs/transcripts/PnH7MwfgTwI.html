<p><span data-start="153.09" data-end="154.769">AWS shop so we are using heavily that</span> <span data-start="154.769" data-end="157.2">part and it was pretty nice so I</span> <span data-start="157.2" data-end="159.09">convinced the the pistas to do an</span> <span data-start="159.09" data-end="161.389">investment and work with micro services</span> <span data-start="161.389" data-end="164.489">because obviously there is a way we can</span> <span data-start="164.489" data-end="167.219">scale the company there is a way that we</span> <span data-start="167.219" data-end="169.439">can they've identified the bonded</span> <span data-start="169.439" data-end="171.689">context around our our domain we can</span> <span data-start="171.689" data-end="173.01">start to work with domain driven design</span> <span data-start="173.01" data-end="176.459">we start to identify what are let's say</span> <span data-start="176.459" data-end="178.379">the best practices definitely there is</span> <span data-start="178.379" data-end="180.54">some overhead but overall if you want to</span> <span data-start="180.54" data-end="182.879">scale a business that a solution that</span> <span data-start="182.879" data-end="186.209">was pallet the reality though is what do</span> <span data-start="186.209" data-end="189.03">you do own from them and that was a</span> <span data-start="189.03" data-end="191.939">question that I had in my career several</span> <span data-start="191.939" data-end="194.189">times because at that stage you know it</span> <span data-start="194.189" data-end="196.919">was pretty obvious that at some point we</span> <span data-start="196.919" data-end="198.629">were scaling but scaling like</span> <span data-start="198.629" data-end="199.469">blitzscaling</span> <span data-start="199.469" data-end="202.139">and it's it's not an easy thing because</span> <span data-start="202.139" data-end="204.359">on front-end usually you don't speak</span> <span data-start="204.359" data-end="206.159">much about architecture usually you</span> <span data-start="206.159" data-end="209.639">steal the wisdom from from the past so</span> <span data-start="209.639" data-end="212.97">you look at I don't know MV IDC I you</span> <span data-start="212.97" data-end="214.56">look from different type of</span> <span data-start="214.56" data-end="216.269">architectures but in reality no one is</span> <span data-start="216.269" data-end="218.129">talking about scale because now is</span> <span data-start="218.129" data-end="220.709">becoming more complex that system so can</span> <span data-start="220.709" data-end="222.209">we do something that was my question at</span> <span data-start="222.209" data-end="227.939">the beginning so I think we can it's not</span> <span data-start="227.939" data-end="231.12">perfect but it's it's a trade of name 40</span> <span data-start="231.12" data-end="233.04">usually says that the reason to the</span> <span data-start="233.04" data-end="235.109">perfect architecture there are only the</span> <span data-start="235.109" data-end="236.909">last worst one and I fully agree with</span> <span data-start="236.909" data-end="238.68">this because in reality is always a</span> <span data-start="238.68" data-end="240.06">trade off is based on the context where</span> <span data-start="240.06" data-end="242.4">you operate is based on the skills of</span> <span data-start="242.4" data-end="243.81">your people is based on several things</span> <span data-start="243.81" data-end="246.12">that are outside the technical part and</span> <span data-start="246.12" data-end="247.859">often we don't take in consideration the</span> <span data-start="247.859" data-end="250.229">part as architects as ly developer tech</span> <span data-start="250.229" data-end="252.419">leads this is very important because if</span> <span data-start="252.419" data-end="255.239">you ignore the company structure you</span> <span data-start="255.239" data-end="257.759">don't try to change that it could bite</span> <span data-start="257.759" data-end="261.06">yourself in in a few months and that</span> <span data-start="261.06" data-end="263.19">that was a huge problem so what we came</span> <span data-start="263.19" data-end="265.65">about was this architecture that was the</span> <span data-start="265.65" data-end="268.289">beginning and now we move to this so</span> <span data-start="268.289" data-end="269.639">what we started to do is</span> <span data-start="269.639" data-end="272.969">okay so let's think about what are the</span> <span data-start="272.969" data-end="274.469">principle of micro-services so we would</span> <span data-start="274.469" data-end="276.9">like to have independent releases we</span> <span data-start="276.9" data-end="279.599">would like to have decisions that are</span> <span data-start="279.599" data-end="281.969">made domain by the main pieces the main</span> <span data-start="281.969" data-end="283.86">business domain I don't want to have any</span> <span data-start="283.86" data-end="286.05">more attack lead that is imposing the</span> <span data-start="286.05" data-end="287.58">decision at first is the beginner</span> <span data-start="287.58" data-end="289.979">project and for the next foreseeable</span> <span data-start="289.979" data-end="292.229">future maintaining the same the same</span> <span data-start="292.229" data-end="293.969">thing that is something that honestly</span> <span data-start="293.969" data-end="296.099">when I was a developer and the tech lead</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="296.099" data-end="299.52">I didn't like much but I do understand</span> <span data-start="299.52" data-end="300.99">why I was like that and the investment</span> <span data-start="300.99" data-end="302.52">for the company wasn't always there</span> <span data-start="302.52" data-end="303.9">because obviously if you ask to the</span> <span data-start="303.9" data-end="305.669">company I need to write an application</span> <span data-start="305.669" data-end="308.039">that is I don't know 10 years old it</span> <span data-start="308.039" data-end="309.389">takes a lot of effort a lot of</span> <span data-start="309.389" data-end="310.86">development and you cannot really do</span> <span data-start="310.86" data-end="313.68">that but with that potentially we can do</span> <span data-start="313.68" data-end="316.289">that potentially we can start to do what</span> <span data-start="316.289" data-end="318.029">we are used to do on on the micro</span> <span data-start="318.029" data-end="319.979">services so applying strangle pattern on</span> <span data-start="319.979" data-end="321.569">the old application and that's more or</span> <span data-start="321.569" data-end="322.77">less what we have done and that will</span> <span data-start="322.77" data-end="326.759">guide you to the journey one piece that</span> <span data-start="326.759" data-end="329.069">is very important for me is the routing</span> <span data-start="329.069" data-end="331.74">part so one thing that we need to nail</span> <span data-start="331.74" data-end="334.199">almost upfront is how do you route</span> <span data-start="334.199" data-end="335.759">between microphone tents and there are</span> <span data-start="335.759" data-end="338.069">several ways I will I will show you what</span> <span data-start="338.069" data-end="340.05">we are doing on our side but as I wrote</span> <span data-start="340.05" data-end="341.819">here you can you can do that on the edge</span> <span data-start="341.819" data-end="343.139">you can do on server side you can do</span> <span data-start="343.139" data-end="344.819">client side there are plenty of</span> <span data-start="344.819" data-end="348.509">possibilities so let's try to define</span> <span data-start="348.509" data-end="350.159">what is a microphone tense because there</span> <span data-start="350.159" data-end="352.319">are many information out there so for me</span> <span data-start="352.319" data-end="354.33">microphone 10 is the representation of a</span> <span data-start="354.33" data-end="356.639">business subdomain and that is very</span> <span data-start="356.639" data-end="358.349">important so we start from from domain</span> <span data-start="358.349" data-end="360.449">driven design they allow independent</span> <span data-start="360.449" data-end="361.86">implementation with same or different</span> <span data-start="361.86" data-end="363.81">technology finally they should avoid</span> <span data-start="363.81" data-end="365.969">should avoid sharing logic I know that</span> <span data-start="365.969" data-end="367.169">is very controversial controversial</span> <span data-start="367.169" data-end="368.55">because we learn something different</span> <span data-start="368.55" data-end="371.099">abstraction and that fix but it's not</span> <span data-start="371.099" data-end="374.43">always the case and finally are owned by</span> <span data-start="374.43" data-end="376.469">a single team so those for me are the</span> <span data-start="376.469" data-end="379.889">key characteristics that are important</span> <span data-start="379.889" data-end="382.469">for 4 micron deaths because having those</span> <span data-start="382.469" data-end="385.439">characteristics allows you to work</span> <span data-start="385.439" data-end="387.93">independently to take local decision</span> <span data-start="387.93" data-end="389.909">over global decision and obviously yes</span> <span data-start="389.909" data-end="392.129">there are let's say some coordination</span> <span data-start="392.129" data-end="393.659">between teams there are community of</span> <span data-start="393.659" data-end="395.52">practices there are several things that</span> <span data-start="395.52" data-end="398.459">are happening outside your team but the</span> <span data-start="398.459" data-end="401.219">reality is no one better than you that</span> <span data-start="401.219" data-end="402.599">you're working that domain can take a</span> <span data-start="402.599" data-end="403.44">decision</span> <span data-start="403.44" data-end="405.03">than anyone else because in reality</span> <span data-start="405.03" data-end="408.09">certain decision you shouldn't get just</span> <span data-start="408.09" data-end="411.15">a one decision that fit them all you</span> <span data-start="411.15" data-end="412.68">need to find the right decision for your</span> <span data-start="412.68" data-end="415.32">business MA and that's why we work with</span> <span data-start="415.32" data-end="418.32">that the other thing is scaling on front</span> <span data-start="418.32" data-end="420.54">m is not a technical problem it's a</span> <span data-start="420.54" data-end="422.4">social problem because the reality think</span> <span data-start="422.4" data-end="424.62">about that if you produce past material</span> <span data-start="424.62" data-end="426.39">time some static files you have to see</span> <span data-start="426.39" data-end="428.1">the end that is absorbing that the heat</span> <span data-start="428.1" data-end="431.28">but the reality is when you are scaling</span> <span data-start="431.28" data-end="434.37">the person for the people factor human</span> <span data-start="434.37" data-end="437.07">being factor is very very important way</span> <span data-start="437.07" data-end="438.39">more important infrastructure for us</span> <span data-start="438.39" data-end="440.82">princess our infrastructure for front</span> <span data-start="440.82" data-end="442.56">end is pretty basic so we have like a</span> <span data-start="442.56" data-end="444.3">cloud form distribution we have an s3</span> <span data-start="444.3" data-end="446.04">bucket and we store everything there and</span> <span data-start="446.04" data-end="447.96">we have a lambda the edge in front and</span> <span data-start="447.96" data-end="450.78">we see later on the Y but the reality is</span> <span data-start="450.78" data-end="454.56">is the how I can have in our case a lot</span> <span data-start="454.56" data-end="457.02">of their centers and work with all those</span> <span data-start="457.02" data-end="460.68">people and accordingly and not blocking</span> <span data-start="460.68" data-end="462.15">each of them because the communication</span> <span data-start="462.15" data-end="465.15">over ad is always a pain if you remember</span> <span data-start="465.15" data-end="466.71">of if you are a developer I remember</span> <span data-start="466.71" data-end="468.27">when I was a developer having external</span> <span data-start="468.27" data-end="469.11">dependencies</span> <span data-start="469.11" data-end="472.89">it was super frustrating and I struggled</span> <span data-start="472.89" data-end="474.36">to who to finish my sprint every time</span> <span data-start="474.36" data-end="476.94">because you really need to nail the part</span> <span data-start="476.94" data-end="478.23">you need to wait for another team and</span> <span data-start="478.23" data-end="479.97">maybe obviously for that team is not a</span> <span data-start="479.97" data-end="481.56">priority that what what you're asking</span> <span data-start="481.56" data-end="482.88">for and so on and so forth</span> <span data-start="482.88" data-end="486.03">so we would like to have like a speed of</span> <span data-start="486.03" data-end="487.38">delivery we would like to have an</span> <span data-start="487.38" data-end="489.93">implement an independent permutation and</span> <span data-start="489.93" data-end="492.66">and that we want we would try to avoid</span> <span data-start="492.66" data-end="494.16">sharing logic that is something that</span> <span data-start="494.16" data-end="497.31">will come back later so there are</span> <span data-start="497.31" data-end="500.46">several

data-end="1039.75">people were going to authentication they</span> <span data-start="1039.75" data-end="1041.069">arrived to the payment they didn't like</span> <span data-start="1041.069" data-end="1042.39">the payment methods that were there and</span> <span data-start="1042.39" data-end="1044.809">then they never finalized the sign up</span> <span data-start="1044.809" data-end="1047.159">the other thing that we notice is when a</span> <span data-start="1047.159" data-end="1049.14">user is signed up they will never logout</span> <span data-start="1049.14" data-end="1052.23">they always remain there so all the code</span> <span data-start="1052.23" data-end="1054.51">related on the authentication the SDK</span> <span data-start="1054.51" data-end="1057.419">for credit card all the other things are</span> <span data-start="1057.419" data-end="1059.49">not useful you wind unload at the moment</span> <span data-start="1059.49" data-end="1062.159">but at at the time but it wasn't useful</span> <span data-start="1062.159" data-end="1064.35">at all so we know that we we had to</span> <span data-start="1064.35" data-end="1067.47">figure out something so what we did is</span> <span data-start="1067.47" data-end="1069.07">ok so we can</span> <span data-start="1069.07" data-end="1070.81">lies our applications vertically so we</span> <span data-start="1070.81" data-end="1072.73">can start to say okay we have like a</span> <span data-start="1072.73" data-end="1074.77">landing page proxy that is loading</span> <span data-start="1074.77" data-end="1077.41">landing page because we have roughly</span> <span data-start="1077.41" data-end="1079.06">hundreds of landing page that are</span> <span data-start="1079.06" data-end="1081.91">dependent from country depends from the</span> <span data-start="1081.91" data-end="1085.21">device depends from the campaign and so</span> <span data-start="1085.21" data-end="1087.04">on so we need something that is</span> <span data-start="1087.04" data-end="1090.01">orchestrating a bit then we need an</span> <span data-start="1090.01" data-end="1091.72">authentication bit that contains signing</span> <span data-start="1091.72" data-end="1094.39">sign up that contains the retrieve email</span> <span data-start="1094.39" data-end="1097.3">password then we have another part that</span> <span data-start="1097.3" data-end="1099.37">is the core part for the zone is the</span> <span data-start="1099.37" data-end="1101.11">discovery part so I want a catalog I</span> <span data-start="1101.11" data-end="1103">want to the best video player for life</span> <span data-start="1103" data-end="1106">possible I won't watch my content at any</span> <span data-start="1106" data-end="1108.46">time I want to watch in any device now</span> <span data-start="1108.46" data-end="1110.5">we have the customer support part and</span> <span data-start="1110.5" data-end="1112.09">finally we have my account those are the</span> <span data-start="1112.09" data-end="1114.13">things that we saw we bucket eyes let's</span> <span data-start="1114.13" data-end="1115.6">say our user journey and we found those</span> <span data-start="1115.6" data-end="1119.32">as prominent microphone tents so we</span> <span data-start="1119.32" data-end="1121.45">decided to go with this so we decided to</span> <span data-start="1121.45" data-end="1124.21">take our application split it but there</span> <span data-start="1124.21" data-end="1126.34">was a missing thing how do we move from</span> <span data-start="1126.34" data-end="1127.72">landing pages to authentication</span> <span data-start="1127.72" data-end="1131.23">that was the big question okay so we</span> <span data-start="1131.23" data-end="1134.11">came up with this idea of bootstrap that</span> <span data-start="1134.11" data-end="1136.68">basically what it does is a a nutshell</span> <span data-start="1136.68" data-end="1139.6">ok so it's like a container that is the</span> <span data-start="1139.6" data-end="1141.4">first Finity load and it will always be</span> <span data-start="1141.4" data-end="1143.26">there for you the moment that you type</span> <span data-start="1143.26" data-end="1144.79">the zone.com or you go to add to the</span> <span data-start="1144.79" data-end="1148.45">application it's always there we will</span> <span data-start="1148.45" data-end="1150.37">see later on what it does but at the</span> <span data-start="1150.37" data-end="1151.9">moment the key thing is that the</span> <span data-start="1151.9" data-end="1153.97">bootstrap is orchestrating this</span> <span data-start="1153.97" data-end="1155.8">microphone dance and is the one that is</span> <span data-start="1155.8" data-end="1159.22">loading or unloading the landing page</span> <span data-start="1159.22" data-end="1162.69">and move to authentication or vice versa</span> <span data-start="1162.69" data-end="1165.82">so we we created some routes so the</span> <span data-start="1165.82" data-end="1167.95">first thing is each microphone then has</span> <span data-start="1167.95" data-end="1170.2">to represent a subdomain matching the</span> <span data-start="1170.2" data-end="1172.75">business structure so currently what we</span> <span data-start="1172.75" data-end="1175.6">have done is we already have the product</span> <span data-start="1175.6" data-end="1178.39">eminent was almost let's say dividing in</span> <span data-start="1178.39" data-end="1179.95">the way that we divided them the</span> <span data-start="1179.95" data-end="1182.41">application but we force certain things</span> <span data-start="1182.41" data-end="1184.12">and currently is working very well</span> <span data-start="1184.12" data-end="1185.59">because they have their dedicated team</span> <span data-start="1185.59" data-end="1187.42">depends from the device but they all</span> <span data-start="1187.42" data-end="1189.58">speak the same o pictus language that</span> <span data-start="1189.58" data-end="1192.31">was the goal then we wanted to have</span> <span data-start="1192.31" data-end="1194.26">technology framework agnostic microphone</span> <span data-start="1194.26" data-end="1196.84">that and I know that a lot of people say</span> <span data-start="1196.84" data-end="1199.18">ok about do you share some some</span> <span data-start="1199.18" data-end="1201.55">libraries do you if they share component</span> <span data-start="1201.55" data-end="1202.45">stuff like that</span> <span data-start="1202.45" data-end="1204.28">so at the beginning we were very very</span> <span data-start="1204.28" data-end="1206.92">pleased no we didn't share anything so</span> <span data-start="1206.92" data-end="1209.29">you have like because of what we have</span> <span data-start="1209.29" data-end="1211.03">seen so for landing page we just have</span> <span data-start="1211.03" data-end="1215.26">and react with a static HTML because we</span> <span data-start="1215.26" data-end="1218.77">compile that sorry we render at compile</span> <span data-start="1218.77" data-end="1221.46">time and we serve static page for</span> <span data-start="1221.46" data-end="1223.27">authentication we have a single page</span> <span data-start="1223.27" data-end="1224.59">application that was made with direct</span> <span data-start="1224.59" data-end="1226.06">but the reality is when you are in</span> <span data-start="1226.06" data-end="1229.47">you're in as we saw before so therefore</span> <span data-start="1229.47" data-end="1232.15">when you load the the main thing the</span> <span data-start="1232.15" data-end="1234.07">core domain of the zone you just load</span> <span data-start="1234.07" data-end="1237.16">once and that's it also on TV the</span> <span data-start="1237.16" data-end="1240.01">performances are improving so we move</span> <span data-start="1240.01" data-end="1241.93">from in certain device from a startup of</span> <span data-start="1241.93" data-end="1244.12">the application of 40 seconds to in very</span> <span data-start="1244.12" data-end="1247.21">old devices to less than 20 so those</span> <span data-start="1247.21" data-end="1249.7">kind of things discuss of logic we're</span> <span data-start="1249.7" data-end="1252">not only dedicated for web but also</span> <span data-start="1252" data-end="1255.12">because for us is very important TVs and</span> <span data-start="1255.12" data-end="1257.32">we want to provide the possibility to</span> <span data-start="1257.32" data-end="1259.06">pick your technology so there was an</span> <span data-start="1259.06" data-end="1260.77">interesting use case landing page guys</span> <span data-start="1260.77" data-end="1262.21">that they saw their rack books and they</span> <span data-start="1262.21" data-end="1263.86">wanted to try the trying production</span> <span data-start="1263.86" data-end="1265.99">didn't say anyone to anyone this thing</span> <span data-start="1265.99" data-end="1268.27">was working no problem at all</span> <span data-start="1268.27" data-end="1270.97">it was pretty simple pretty quick in one</span> <span data-start="1270.97" data-end="1273.46">sprint they replaced what they wanted to</span> <span data-start="1273.46" data-end="1275.44">to test the pudding production was</span> <span data-start="1275.44" data-end="1277.39">working hit by minutes of user done and</span> <span data-start="1277.39" data-end="1280.92">then they share their let's say</span> <span data-start="1280.92" data-end="1282.79">information they shared what they have</span> <span data-start="1282.79" data-end="1284.41">learned from that that was pretty</span> <span data-start="1284.41" data-end="1286.42">interesting use case then the other</span> <span data-start="1286.42" data-end="1287.74">thing is I want to have a microphone on</span> <span data-start="1287.74" data-end="1289.72">these autonomous I don't want to deploy</span> <span data-start="1289.72" data-end="1292.59">them the authentication mic from time</span> <span data-start="1292.59" data-end="1295.57">coordinating that with the discovery I</span> <span data-start="1295.57" data-end="1297.4">want that they can deploy just one of</span> <span data-start="1297.4" data-end="1299.11">that because that's the whole point</span> <span data-start="1299.11" data-end="1301.96">if I can do that and they need to make</span> <span data-start="1301.96" data-end="1306.64">some some say strong decisions therefore</span> <span data-start="1306.64" data-end="1310.69">no code sorry no obstructions as poor as</span> <span data-start="1310.69" data-end="1313.11">much as possible I can I can do that</span> <span data-start="1313.11" data-end="1316">then inside the microphone thank the</span> <span data-start="1316" data-end="1318.1">team can share components code size and</span> <span data-start="1318.1" data-end="1320.26">so on that is another thing that we we</span> <span data-start="1320.26" data-end="1323.35">we assess we create independent building</span> <span data-start="1323.35" data-end="1325.9">system now I know that a lot of people</span> <span data-start="1325.9" data-end="1328.03">would think ok but why you don't provide</span> <span data-start="1328.03" data-end="1330.1">that we provide the basics so we have</span> <span data-start="1330.1" data-end="1332.38">like a drone that is running but what is</span> <span data-start="1332.38" data-end="1334.42">inside a container that is running on</span> <span data-start="1334.42" data-end="1336.07">drone is up to the team to the size</span> <span data-start="1336.07" data-end="1337.78">because they can have optimization that</span> <span data-start="1337.78" data-end="1341.02">other teams shouldn't shouldn't have or</span> <span data-start="1341.02" data-end="1343">they want to translate certain things</span> <span data-start="1343" data-end="1343.9">that don't have so they have like</span> <span data-start="1343.9" data-end="1347.56">several plugins for roll-up and flora</span> <span data-start="1347.56" data-end="1350.26">for web puck and they can use them share</span> <span data-start="1350.26" data-end="1351.52">between teams it's not a problem at all</span> <span data-start="1351.52" data-end="1353.62">but that's that's how it works you have</span> <span data-start="1353.62" data-end="1355.63">an important thing for me is when you</span> <span data-start="1355.63" data-end="1357.76">have a booster uploaded you always load</span> <span data-start="1357.76" data-end="1359.59">one Mike from 10 per time you will never</span> <span data-start="1359.59" data-end="1361.15">compose anything on the client side you</span> <span data-start="1361.15" data-end="1363.1">always load a single page application or</span> <span data-start="1363.1" data-end="1365.65">a single page because in that case it</span> <span data-start="1365.65" data-end="1367.81">means that you're using the they let's</span> <span data-start="1367.81" data-end="1370">say the Holy Trinity of JavaScript so</span> <span data-start="1370" data-end="1372.97">use HTML uses as huge JavaScript and you</span> <span data-start="1372.97" data-end="1374.23">don't have to compose an if you don't</span> <span data-start="1374.23"

data-end="1382.84">some time that the complexity of a</span> <span data-start="1382.84" data-end="1385.24">domain became too big on the back on the</span> <span data-start="1385.24"

data-end="1392.17">is this working like a charm so as I</span> <span data-start="1392.17" data-end="1394.48">said the microphone tent for us is the</span> </p>

that I</span> <span data-start="1746.289" data-end="1748.39">decided to add is the cannery release</span> <span data-start="1748.39" data-end="1751.21">thing so they caught the company ask me</span> <span data-start="1751.21" data-end="1755.26">can we have a way to in general not wait</span> <span data-start="1755.26" data-end="1757.029">for building all the microphone pans and</span> <span data-start="1757.029" data-end="1759.549">deploy them and there at the beginning</span> <span data-start="1759.549" data-end="1760.84">was a bit puzzled because I said yes</span> <span

data-start="1764.89" data-end="1766.809">because our architecture was very simple</span> <span data-start="1766.809" data-end="1769.779">crowd from and that's free I thought ok</span> <span data-start="1769.779" data-end="1772.149">let's write lambda the edge now at the</span> <span data-start="1772.149" data-end="1774.25">edge if you're not familiar it can be</span> <span

data-end="1797.049">that case you can orchestrate sort of</span> <span data-start="1797.049" data-end="1800.399">things so what we have done basically is</span> <span data-start="1800.399" data-end="1803.14">deciding in so we started to say ok we</span> <span data-start="1803.14" data-end="1804.97">want to deploy in a specific country on</span> <span data-start="1804.97" data-end="1807.669">a specific browser or device and we want</span> <span data-start="1807.669" data-end="1809.799">to deploy that and every time there is</span> <span data-start="1809.799" data-end="1812.59">another request boom it goes to 1.0 so</span> <span data-start="1812.59" data-end="1815.799">that allows us to do many and</span> <span data-start="1815.799" data-end="1818.11">incremental deployment per day then</span> <span data-start="1818.11" data-end="1819.669">before it was a nightmare in particular</span> <span data-start="1819.669" data-end="1822.46">for TV so the other guys thing is we can</span> <span data-start="1822.46" data-end="1824.559">we decide to go a very deep granularity</span> <span data-start="1824.559" data-end="1827.649">so country and browser because this</span> <span data-start="1827.649" data-end="1829.48">depends from the browser what kind of</span> <span data-start="1829.48" data-end="1831.7">video player you need to use and that</span> <span data-start="1831.7" data-end="1834.429">was pretty interesting because I have</span> <span data-start="1834.429" data-end="1836.02">like if search on YouTube there is a</span> <span data-start="1836.02" data-end="1838.149">talk that I did that bring vent about</span> <span data-start="1838.149" data-end="1842.289">this with a SS I was an interesting</span> <span data-start="1842.289" data-end="1844.87">topic we also managed to do SEO through</span> <span data-start="1844.87"

data-end="1861.22">switching the the things to letters was</span> <span data-start="1861.22" data-end="1863.559">a pretty pretty nice understanding that</span> <span data-start="1863.559" data-end="1865.87">we were on the right track ok so as I</span> <span data-start="1865.87" data-end="1869.02">said the dissolve structure on the DDD</span> <span data-start="1869.02" data-end="1870.16">part</span> <span data-start="1870.16" data-end="1871.9">something like that so we try to take</span> <span data-start="1871.9" data-end="1873.58">all out all the things that you
