gonna be I'm gonna assume</span> <span data-start="2409.33" data-end="2413.13">there's a method here that says like</span> <span data-start="2413.13" data-end="2416.74">activate or so something a custom method</span> <span data-start="2416.74" data-end="2418.9">that you want to call when this page has</span> <span data-start="2418.9" data-end="2420.76">rendered you can do it with first up</span> <span data-start="2420.76" data-end="2422.56">updated but I just want to show you</span> <span data-start="2422.56" data-end="2424.15">something that has to do with</span> <span

data-end="2444.58">the page we're gonna have up stock it</span> <span data-start="2444.58" data-end="2447.61">works and the nice thing about our</span> <span data-start="2447.61" data-end="2449.47">components is that they are just HTML</span> <span data-start="2449.47" data-end="2452.35">elements with their own properties and</span> <span data-start="2452.35"

data-end="2460.35">custom method and that works great</span> <span data-start="2460.35" data-end="2464.08">activate was called until you decide you</span> <span data-start="2464.08"

data-end="2493.03">and it works but this is gonna break now</span> <span data-start="2493.03" data-end="2495.28">because at the moment this is running</span> <span data-start="2495.28" data-end="2499.57">app stock doesn't exist so you can do it</span> <span data-start="2499.57" data-end="2501.64">in multiple ways you can you can do it</span> <span data-start="2501.64" data-end="2503.68">with the dog down here I just want to</span> <span data-start="2503.68" data-end="2505.36">show you another method with custom</span> <span data-start="2505.36"
