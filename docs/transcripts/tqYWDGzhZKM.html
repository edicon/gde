<p><span data-start="13.39" data-end="17.25">So yeah, as Tab said, I've kind of been doing things</span> <span data-start="17.25" data-end="19.92">on the web for a very long time.</span> <span data-start="19.92" data-end="21.62">I do all kinds of things, it's very hard for me</span> <span data-start="21.62" data-end="23.41">to tell conferences exactly what they should put</span> <span data-start="23.41" data-end="25.583">on my badge as my kind of job.</span> <span data-start="26.425" data-end="28.65">I do lots of things, let's say importantly</span> <span data-start="28.65" data-end="30.89">I am the W3C representative for Fronteers,</span> <span data-start="30.89" data-end="31.77">I've been asked to mention</span> <span data-start="31.77" data-end="33.18">that we have a meetup this evening</span> <span data-start="33.18" data-end="34.1">which you can come along to,</span> <span data-start="34.1" data-end="35.43">I'll be speaking at that as well,</span> <span data-start="35.43" data-end="38.63">because I like to speak about CSS twice in one day.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="38.63" data-end="41.023">So do come along though, it should be good fun.</span> <span data-start="42.09" data-end="43.93">So really for this talk though,</span> <span data-start="43.93" data-end="46.31">I've been really teaching CSS for as long</span> <span data-start="46.31" data-end="50.79">as I've been writing CSS and that's kind of about 20 years.</span> <span data-start="50.79" data-end="52.12">I've written an awful lot of books</span> <span data-start="52.12" data-end="54.5">and articles and so on.</span> <span data-start="54.5" data-end="58.287">And one of those books was titled, not by me, as,</span> <span data-start="58.287" data-end="61.15">"Everything You Know About CSS is Wrong".</span> <span data-start="61.15" data-end="63.62">And it was a ridiculous title.</span> <span data-start="63.62" data-end="67.623">But maybe today I could almost justify using that.</span> <span data-start="69.61" data-end="72.38">Because I've taught CSS and CSS for layout</span> <span data-start="72.38" data-end="75.47">in pretty much the same way everybody else has.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="75.47" data-end="78.2">This is a block thing, this is an inline thing.</span> <span data-start="78.2" data-end="80.77">You can change the things between block and inline.</span> <span data-start="80.77" data-end="83.72">Hey, this is the box model, it's very important.</span> <span data-start="83.72" data-end="86.17">But it's also a bit weird.</span> <span data-start="86.17" data-end="88.44">And then we do this stuff with widths and floats</span> <span data-start="88.44" data-end="91.473">to try and make something that looks like a grid.</span> <span data-start="93.71" data-end="96.51">And over the past few years I've been writing</span> <span data-start="96.51" data-end="98.29">and speaking about our new layout methods.</span> <span data-start="98.29" data-end="100.94">I've been talking about Flexbox and Grid</span> <span data-start="100.94" data-end="102.91">and I'm constantly reordering my material,</span> <span data-start="102.91" data-end="105.8">often kind of on the fly in front of people in workshops</span> <span data-start="105.8" data-end="109.41">as I kind of hear questions that don't quite make sense</span> <span data-start="109.41" data-end="111.24">and I realize that people haven't quite got</span> <span data-start="111.24" data-end="112.503">what we're teaching.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="113.72" data-end="116.17">And it's become apparent to me that the way that we have</span> <span data-start="116.17" data-end="120.01">taught CSS doesn't really work with the new systems</span> <span data-start="120.01" data-end="121.63">that we're creating.</span> <span data-start="121.63" data-end="125.223">It's not giving people the ability to master new layout.</span> <span data-start="126.29" data-end="128.29">And more than that, more importantly than that,</span> <span data-start="128.29" data-end="130.32">I think that our continued teaching and talking</span> <span data-start="130.32" data-end="134.16">about CSS as if it's some kind of weird, quirky thing</span> <span data-start="134.16" data-end="137.74">encourages people to not take it seriously as a language.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="137.74" data-end="140.9">And to do all they can to kind of avoid using features</span> <span data-start="140.9" data-end="142.933">that are part of the language.</span> <span data-start="144.67" data-end="147.44">So in this talk, I'm going to describe CSS Layout</span> <span data-start="147.44" data-end="152.01">as a system in a way that I believe we need to set it out.</span> <span data-start="152.01" data-end="154.65">How we need to set out our store when we talk to people</span> <span data-start="154.65" data-end="156.95">about CSS Layout.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="156.95" data-end="159.23">And I'm doing this not to teach you CSS,</span> <span data-start="159.23" data-end="161.05">'cause I'm pretty sure that most of you in this room</span> <span data-start="161.05" data-end="163.64">know a lot of this stuff, but to show you</span> <span data-start="163.64" data-end="166.29">how to talk about CSS to your teams,</span> <span data-start="166.29" data-end="168.24">or when you're writing articles or teaching people</span> <span data-start="168.24" data-end="169.65">or answering questions on Twitter,</span> <span data-start="169.65" data-end="171.27">'cause I think a lot of us are teaching,</span> <span data-start="171.27" data-end="174.92">even if we wouldn't call ourselves teachers.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="174.92" data-end="176.83">Because I believe that if we want this language</span> <span data-start="176.83" data-end="178.89">to be seen as a real language,</span> <span data-start="178.89" data-end="181.03">as something important and elegant,</span> <span data-start="181.03" data-end="183.75">and to be seen in the same light as other things,</span> <span data-start="183.75" data-end="185.64">we really have to start talking about it</span> <span data-start="185.64" data-end="189.223">in that way, in the way that we want it to be treated.</span> <span data-start="192" data-end="193.98">Other languages, when we approach them with beginners,</span> <span data-start="193.98" data-end="196.71">if we've got a complete beginner to programming,</span> <span data-start="196.71" data-end="198.91">we begin with the important constructs of working</span> <span data-start="198.91" data-end="199.94">with those languages.</span> <span data-start="199.94" data-end="202.45">So you know, if you're teaching someone JavaScript,</span> <span data-start="202.45" data-end="204.57">you're going to teach them variables, basic math,</span> <span data-start="204.57" data-end="207.12">string handling, conditional logic.</span> <span data-start="207.12" data-end="209.14">You do all of that before you start saying,</span> <span data-start="209.14" data-end="211.49">well, hack around with this website.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="211.49" data-end="213.82">With CSS what we do is we teach a couple of things,</span> <span data-start="213.82" data-end="214.75">and then we just start getting people</span> <span data-start="214.75" data-end="218.73">to poke things around and hope that it sort of works.</span> <span data-start="218.73" data-end="220.47">They're not giving them a best way to start</span> <span data-start="220.47" data-end="222.46">on a good footing, and it's no wonder then</span> <span data-start="222.46" data-end="225.07">that people become reliant on frameworks</span> <span data-start="225.07" data-end="226.35">often going to Stack Overflow</span> <span data-start="226.35" data-end="228.85">and just copying and pasting the nearest thing they see.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="228.85" data-end="231.56">And asking questions, even a very long way down the line</span> <span data-start="231.56" data-end="233.75">of them working with CSS that make you realize</span> <span data-start="233.75" data-end="235.71">that they don't actually understand</span> <span data-start="235.71" data-end="238.66">what is going on in the language when they're doing things.</span> <span data-start="240.64" data-end="242.41">So this is really my attempt to kind of try</span> <span data-start="242.41" data-end="246.2">and create a robust footing for layout.</span> <span data-start="246.2" data-end="248.33">And you'll notice here that I've not actually mentioned</span> <span data-start="248.33" data-end="251.87">sort of Grid and Flexbox as independent things.</span> <span data-start="251.87" data-end="253.39">Because I think that by treating them</span> <span data-start="253.39" data-end="256.26">as independent things, we're adding to this strange idea</span> <span data-start="256.26" data-end="258.65">that when you pick between Grid and Flexbox,</span> <span data-start="258.65" data-end="261.343">it's like choosing between Bootstrap and Foundation.</span> <span data-start="262.31" data-end="264.98">Instead, we need to find the fundamentals</span> <span data-start="264.98" data-end="266.98">and teach the fundamentals.</span> <span data-start="266.98" data-end="268.69">And while you're doing that, you can introduce</span> <span data-start="268.69" data-end="270.8">an awful lot of Grid and Flexbox along the way,</span> <span data-start="270.8" data-end="273.35">because that's how we can demonstrate these things.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="274.34" data-end="276.81">But once people understand the underlying</span> <span data-start="276.81" data-end="278.97">fundamental parts of the system,</span> <span data-start="278.97" data-end="281.33">the things that tie together the headline features</span> <span data-start="281.33" data-end="284.71">of Flexbox and Grid, a lot of the rest is really</span> <span data-start="284.71" data-end="286.823">just learning syntax.</span> <span data-start="290.02" data-end="292.47">So CSS has a system for layout.</span> <span data-start="292.47" data-end="294.75">It's how we allow webpages and web applications</span> <span data-start="294.75" data-end="297.59">and the main layout methods all belong</span> <span data-start="297.59" data-end="299.58">to the display property.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="299.58" data-end="302.95">They're essentially just a value of display.</span> <span data-start="302.95" data-end="306.17">If you want to do layout, you are changing the value</span> <span data-start="306.17" data-end="309.35">of display, so that's really the best place to start.</span> <span data-start="309.35" data-end="310.403">What is display?</span> <span data-start="313.9" data-end="317.33">And everything starts on the web with Normal Flow,</span> <span data-start="317.33" data-end="319.13">with block and inline layout.</span> <span data-start="319.13" data-end="321.41">We're always returning to that.</span> <span data-start="321.41" data-end="324.22">And we need to understand this is the default state</span> <span data-start="324.22" data-end="326.81">of layout, the state to which we return</span> <span data-start="326.81" data-end="329.153">if we don't do anything else.</span> <span data-start="330.15" data-end="333.41">Items that participate in the block formatting context.</span> <span data-start="333.41" data-end="336.097">We often talk about this as kind of being no layout,</span> <span data-start="336.097" data-end="338.76">but it's layout, it's block and inline layout.</span> <span data-start="338.76" data-end="342.33">Each box is a block thing or an inline thing.</span> <span data-start="342.33" data-end="344.57">And if you write some HTML and just open it up</span> <span data-start="344.57" data-end="347.41">in a web browser, there it is, your HTML document</span> <span data-start="347.41" data-end="349.11">defining a block formatting context,</span> <span data-start="349.11" data-end="352.04">and the items inside participating in it.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="352.04" data-end="353.467">The block things do what block things do,</span> <span data-start="353.467" data-end="355.76">and the inline things do what inline things do.</span> <span data-start="355.76" data-end="359.01">And we have some readable content,</span> <span data-start="359.01" data-end="361.34">because CSS is doing some work for us there,</span> <span data-start="361.34" data-end="363.32">by way of the browser's inbuilt style sheet,</span> <span data-start="363.32" data-end="365.373">before we actually write any CSS.</span> <span data-start="367.031" data-end="368.49">And I think it's pretty important for us</span> <span data-start="368.49" data-end="370.48">to understand Normal Flow in this way,</span> <span data-start="370.48" data-end="372.06">as actually a layout method.</span> <span data-start="372.06" data-end="374.87">And it's important for us to teach it this way.</span> <span data-start="374.87" data-end="376.31">Because right out of the gate,</span> <span data-start="376.31" data-end="378.23">CSS is doing this stuff for us.</span> <span data-start="378.23" data-end="379.69">We don't need to define the way</span> <span data-start="379.69" data-end="382.68">that every single HTML element looks.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="382.68" data-end="383.61">We don't have to worry</span> <span data-start="383.61" data-end="386.15">about things overlapping on our page.</span> <span data-start="386.15" data-end="388.04">CSS is doing that for us.</span> <span data-start="388.04" data-end="390.53">How fortunate are we to have this amazing framework</span> <span data-start="390.53" data-end="394.74">that gives us this great starting point for our designs?</span> <span data-start="394.74" data-end="396.47">And it's very important that we work</span> <span data-start="396.47" data-end="398.95">with it, not against it.</span> <span data-start="398.95" data-end="402.16">If we strip everything away with a heavy handed reset</span> <span data-start="402.16" data-end="405.56">style sheet, then we're losing something really useful,</span> <span data-start="405.56" data-end="406.84">something which is actually doing a bunch</span> <span data-start="406.84" data-end="408.21">of our work for us.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="408.21" data-end="410.633">We have to end up putting everything back in.</span> <span data-start="413.57" data-end="416.595">So once we understand that we've got layout,</span> <span data-start="416.595" data-end="417.74">and our items are participating</span> <span data-start="417.74" data-end="420.58">in the block format in context, we better understand</span> <span data-start="420.58" data-end="423.3">what it is to change the value of display,</span> <span data-start="423.3" data-end="425.71">to create a different kind of layout.</span> <span data-start="425.71" data-end="427.39">My items here are displaying one</span> <span data-start="427.39" data-end="430.183">below the other as block items.</span> <span data-start="432.55" data-end="436.76">If I change the value of display on their container to flex,</span> <span data-start="436.76" data-end="439.48">the items now display alongside each other.</span> <span data-start="439.48" data-end="441.49">They're now flex items.</span> <span data-start="441.49" data-end="442.47">They're not participating in</span> <span data-start="442.47" data-end="443.94">that block's formatting context,</span> <span data-start="443.94" data-end="445.07">they're doing their own thing,</span> <span data-start="445.07" data-end="447.02">they're in a flex formatting context.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="447.02" data-end="449.8">And that comes with some initial values</span> <span data-start="449.8" data-end="451.71">of the various flex properties.</span> <span data-start="451.71" data-end="454.55">So our things here are displaying in a row</span> <span data-start="454.55" data-end="457.82">by default because that's the initial value.</span> <span data-start="457.82" data-end="460.64">They're not stretching, they're all aligned to start,</span> <span data-start="460.64" data-end="462.83">they're not stretching on the main axis.</span> <span data-start="462.83" data-end="464.84">So that's kind of the basic values</span> <span data-start="464.84" data-end="466.233">of those flex items.</span> <span data-start="467.67" data-end="469.73">Now if I change the value to grid,</span> <span data-start="469.73" data-end="472.6">the items now participate in a grid formatting context.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="472.6" data-end="474.69">Now by default when you create a grid,</span> <span data-start="474.69" data-end="477.74">you end up with a one column grid,</span> <span data-start="477.74" data-end="479.266">so then we just get a single column grid,</span> <span data-start="479.266" data-end="480.73">actually doesn't look very different.</span> <span data-start="480.73" data-end="484">And so we need to add some column or row tracks</span> <span data-start="484" data-end="486.14">to make something happen, so here I've added</span> <span data-start="486.14" data-end="489.963">three column tracks and so I get a three column grid.</span> <span data-start="492.64" data-end="494.75">But whether we say display grid</span> <span data-start="494.75" data-end="497.68">or whether we say display flex,</span> <span data-start="497.68" data-end="500.11">we're only doing that on that element.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="500.11" data-end="502.81">It becomes the grid container or the flex container,</span> <span data-start="502.81" data-end="506.48">and its children become grid or flex items.</span> <span data-start="506.48" data-end="510.593">Their children go right back to doing flow layout.</span> <span data-start="511.992" data-end="513.65">And we can see that if I add some more content</span> <span data-start="513.65" data-end="516.72">to one of my grid items, a header and two paragraphs,</span> <span data-start="516.72" data-end="518.77">they go right back to flow layout.</span> <span data-start="518.77" data-end="521.15">And so it goes all the way down</span> <span data-start="521.15" data-end="523.22">through the structure of your site.</span> </p>
<p><span data-start="523.22" data-end="525.25">You can stay with that flow layout,</span> <span data-start="525.25" data-end="526.99">the block formatting context, or you can switch</span> <span data-start="526.99" data-end="528.68">to other formatting context.</span> <span data-start="528.68" data-end="531.18">Inside that, you're going to return to flow layout</span> <span data-start="531.18" data-end="532.75">unless you make that decision again</span> <span data-start="532.75" data-end="535.03">and change the value of display.</span> <span data-start="535.03" data-end="538.23">One box at a time all the way down.</span> </p>
